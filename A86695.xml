            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Your enemies, and the Churches oppreſſers wil not ſpare to add to your afflictions, perſecuting you as evill doers, and charging you with <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loialty,</hi> a Crime more bitter than your ſufferings, were the charge but juſt; unjuſt aſperſions will turne to greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour at the laſt, therfore may be preſent comforts; I pray both for my ſelfe and you, the abhorring of that <hi>Sinne</hi> next to Rebellion againſt the Lord of Glory; I truſt we ſhall ſtrive
<pb facs="tcp:111779:3"/>equally againſt it, &amp; be approved before the Reproacher in the latter end. But why diſloyall? if I may a little reaſon) becauſe obedient to the lawfull commands of the true funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall power ordained by God over us? ſuch obedience cannot be Treaſon, unleſſe that power bee Traiterous; and before this Age it was never known that a true Parliament was a ſubject capable of the crime of Treaſon; and truer than this rais'd according to the fundamental conſtitutions of this Kingdome never was any, let the enemy himſelfe be Judge. In this caſe it is ſafer to be accounted a Traitor for obedience to ſuch a power, then to bee one indeede by reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it. To the accuſers returne, The <hi>Myſtery of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity,</hi> as it covers ſinne in poyſoning, ſo it hides the cauſe in perſecuting; It pretends Chriſt, when it would convey into the Soule the very <hi>Hell</hi> of Antichriſt, and it cries out Faction, Treaſon, when it would murther outright Chriſt in his Members; And this deviſe is too well knowne now, than that Gods choſen ſhould bee deluded by it; wiſh them againe to leave calling Traitors, and waite for the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in the next Generation, which will more truely tell the generations to come, who have beene indeede Traitors in this Age: And tell them once more, it little concerns the Saints in this matter to be indged in mans <hi>day</hi> or of mans <hi>judgement;</hi> Gods <hi>day</hi> and <hi>judgement</hi> are haſting on, unto which alone doe we appeale: There ſhall they anſwer Chriſt and us, and untill then wee will patiently beare and wait for ſentence from our Iudge.</p>
            <p>Your great ſuffering in the eyes of others both God and Men will finde, I hope, better acceptance, and draw ſweeter expresſions for returne: God hath not hid his face from you in yours deepeſt darkneſſe; in the flame he hath kept your Buſh from burning, and in the furnace your ſelves and
<pb facs="tcp:111779:3"/>ſubſtance yet from conſuming All that I pray for you is, ye may not be found unthankful nor unfruitful, but that ye may tread in the ſteps of Gods <hi>boſom-ſonne</hi> to learne obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by all that ye have ſuffered, and returne unto the Lord according to mercies received.</p>
            <p>For your helpe in this courſe, I am bold to preſent this worke to your eyes and hearts to be ſeene and ſtudied: My firſt conceptions of it (I confeſſe) were occaſioned by my owne afflictions, for my owne uſe, which though bitter to the fleſh, I hoped to ſweeten by the Spirit of theſe truths bound up in this Apoſtolicall advertiſement to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Hebrewes: and I bleſſe God, my hope did not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faile nice in this matter. Afterwards my thoughts were inlarged to ſome Sermons upon this ſubiect, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to keepe cloſe theſe reviving cordialls, but to impart them in meaſure for the comfort of Gods afflicted; The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſome of theſe to have thoſe words under their eyes, which did but touch their eares, hath prevailed with me to compoſe all in this Treatiſe, &amp; now to make it of publike uſe. Yet in ſending it abroad my hearts deſire is to give it a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall direction unto you, and my prayer to God, that it may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly be profitable to your ſoules: To the love and care wherof as I am ingaged by the more ſpeciall bonds of Chriſt; ſo if you may better proſper under chastenings by this first fruit of my labour on you, it will be my full rejoycing.</p>
            <p>I preſent this worke to you, and the afflicted Church, the rather at this ſeaſon, to bee both a remedy againſt preſent preſſures, and an Antidote againſt the malignity of future troubles in the fleſh, which the Holy Ghoſt ſeem's to bid us to expect in theſe laſt dayes of teſtifying againſt the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and his vaſſal creatures, if we be the Saints of God: he points at our time, and all that ſpace remaining to the
<pb facs="tcp:111779:4"/>harveſt of Antichriſt,<note place="margin">Revel. 14.12.</note> with that finger, <hi>Here is the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Saints;</hi> Here and now trialls enough ſhall be raiſed to exerciſe the patience of Gods Saints, but no cauſe to undervalue Saintſhip for this. Bleſſed Saints in this time that ſtore up patience, that <hi>keepe the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God and the faith of Ieſus;</hi> The victory and Kingdome ſhall be theirs. If any afflicted ſoule may by this Treatiſe be directed to its due exerciſe under the rod, and help't on to the receiving of the deſired fruit, it is all I aime at, that God may be glorified in it.</p>
            <p>Vpon you <hi>(dearely beloved and longed for)</hi> J caſt this ſeede with a great hope of a ſweete returne of a treble fruit, <hi>toward the rod, toward your God, toward your ſelves,</hi> which I beſeech the Father of mercies by the word of bleſsing to perfect, &amp; you by your obedience to helpe on, that we be not aſhamed. <hi>1. Towards the rod,</hi> I ſhall long and hope for your returne of <hi>patience</hi> in a ſweete bearing of it, that ye neither faint under it nor deſpiſe it; of <hi>obedience</hi> in a due hearing of it, that like the Bee, yee may worke hony out of every netle; and of <hi>diligence</hi> or watchfulneſſe to be conformed to Gods Covenant, for which the Rod pleads, that it may be as the <hi>thorne</hi> at the Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales breaſt, your conſtant <hi>Awakener</hi> unto God.</p>

Saints are but <hi>Lamps</hi> or Candles of God, they burne and ſhine to ſhew his beauty, and at laſt are done,<note place="margin">Col. Gould.</note> goe out ſweetly and expire in his glory. Such a <hi>Lamp</hi> is lately gone out with you, that is burnt &amp; ſpent for Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:111779:4"/>his Church and you; His life was <hi>light,</hi> and that deſired, his death darkeneſſe, not in yours onely but the kingdomes Hemiſphaere, and that lamented: I cannot thinke upon ſuch a publike <hi>Man</hi> but with Honour, and though <hi>Envy</hi> barke, the memory of the iuſt ſhall be bleſſed; I mention him onely to move you to a repaire of ſuch a Light, Be all ſo; burne and ſhine, and ſpend ſtate, and parts, and lives to become at laſt Gods <hi>Glory</hi> in expiring.</p>

               <hi>3. Towards your ſelves,</hi> I pray and waite for out of all your troubles the fruit of <hi>Love</hi> &amp; <hi>Vnion;</hi> though in times of peace Chriſtians may perhaps grow fat, and proud, and wanton, and kick with the heele, yet me thinks the rod and afflictions ſhould tame them; Though in the palace the Martyres may contend, the stake did ſurely make them friends: One ſcourge upon all backs for one cauſe, by one Adverſary, will certainely whip the hearts of them together that ſuffer: Either ye are not all <hi>indeed ſufferers</hi> in the ſame cauſe of Chriſt, (if ſo, let Hypocrites unmaske them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) or elſe ye must bee of the ſame heart and minde; O let that curſed <hi>ſelfe</hi> dye, and let <hi>Chriſt</hi> live in you, then ye ſhall bee of one heart and of one minde. <hi>Selfe-conceit, Selfe-ends, Selfe-pleaſing,</hi> let them periſh; Is this a time to ſeeke things for our ſelves? Seeke Chriſt, ſerve and pleaſe one another in him; no way ſo holy and ſo proſperous. Let the rod have ſuch an anſwer: or if by any other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I may, let me now beg you into mutual love and ſweet accord; I will ſtrive by the Apoſtles ſtrength: <hi>Beloved, if there</hi> be <hi>any conſolation in Chriſt,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:111779:5"/>will be my joy, your diviſions from him my greateſt <hi>griefe:</hi> Honour Chriſt, and comfort me, and bleſſe your ſelves in yeelding this fruit.

                     <hi>Cauſe thy face to ſhine, and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi> The fruition of all this is matter of joy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3. God weighs the ſmart, and yet he whips his children,<note place="margin">Chaſtening ſerves to fulfill the covenant.</note> with reſpect to his covenant made in Chriſt with them. The ſum thereof is, to be<note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note>

Now in drawing the lines to glory, one conſtant paſſage both to his naturall Son in the fleſh, and his adopted ones in affliction.

Therefore in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:111779:13"/>the midſt of all the ſtripes he ſpeakes of to be laid on the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> the children of promiſe, he orders and meaſures all by his covenant and truth to them: However I viſit them with ſcourges,<note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 89.33.34.</note>

Gods Amen-covenant implies the rod as uſefull to its end: when God corrects, he ſaith not <hi>Nay,</hi> nor contradicts his <hi>Yes</hi> to love and ſave his people, the ſcourge ſaith <hi>Amen</hi> to ſave the ſoul, as much as the ſtaffe of bread, or comfort. <hi>David</hi> ſweetly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth this, and accepts of his chaſtening thankfully,<note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 119, 75.</note>

To cry and howle with ſorrow, and charge God fooliſhly, or blaſpheme him, is a reprobate ſtate: Children will grieve, ſubmit, and fall downe at the foot of a diſpleaſed father, to honour him, and be guided by him; God looks for this at all times.<note n="p" place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="2">2. Abundance or fulneſſe is implyed in this alſo;<note place="margin">Deut. 28.4.</note> Fruit in this kind is a collective terme; As the fruit of the land, is not one eare or ſheafe, but the crop,<note place="margin">Deut. 22.9.</note> and the fruit of the vineyard is not one grape or cluſter in the uſuall ſpeech, but many cluſters or all the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; ſo not one ſweet or good can bee the fruit of chaſtening com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, but the harveſt and crop of many <hi>goods</hi> and <hi>ſweets:</hi> ſo that the weight of this generall word commends thus farre the gaine of chaſtenings, It is a full cup of all good things for ſoules delight; And yet adde one thing more, for honour of Gods Scourge, if this bee <hi>fruit</hi> of chaſtening, it is as firmely intailed on the rod, as the grape upon the vine, or the apple on its tree, or the cherry on its graffe; All this is carried in the terme of fruit.</p>

Now as given us of God, the uſe of it is either proper, or figurative. In the proper uſe of it there
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:111779:20"/>be two ſignificats. 1 Gods work upon us, changing our conditions, not our natures,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. Ier. 23.6.</note> wiping out our guilt, not our ſtaines, which is the gift of righteouſneſſe or our juſtification in and by the Lord our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. This cannot bee intended here, for chaſtening ſuppoſeth men the adopted and juſtified of God already; this then cannot bee gained by it. 2 Gods worke in us by the ſanctification of our natures, even an univerſall frame of rectitude in our hearts conforme to the revealed will of God: it anſwers to that holineſſe whereof God aimes to make us partakers by his chaſtening, which in effect is the fruit of righteouſneſſe; it is ſummed up intirely together in thoſe titles, <hi>the new creation, the forme or image of Chriſt, and the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> In its parts or members deſcribed, it is knowledge of God, faith in God, love to God, walking with God exactly in the right way and due ſeaſons of his worſhip; it is obedience, meekneſſe, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, contentedneſſe, humility, bowels, chaſtity, goodneſſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right converſation, and whatever elſe is required to the integrity of a Chriſtian,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.11.</note> with theſe fruits of righteouſneſſe the Apoſtle praies the Church of God may bee filled by Chriſt Ieſus: Theſe in their collection and growth are the fruit of ſcourgings; no deſpicable gaine. Againe in the figurative or metonymicall uſe of this terme, it notes all the inſaperable adjuncts and conſequents of this righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in ſhort, eternall life, kingdome of glory, throne and crown of righteouſneſſe, ſo ſtiled becauſe aſſigned to it: It pleaſeth ſome to grant the former, but deny this to bee the intended fruit of chaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;<note place="margin">Eſtius in text.</note> I confeſſe that more immediately iſſueth from the rod, but why ſhould we not ſuppoſe life as neere to righteouſneſſe, as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to the rod? nay it will be neceſſary with this intaile to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this fruit, if we duely conſider one rule which I thinke will not faile us, <hi>That whatſoever righteouſneſſe is promiſed, or expreſſed as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or conſequent of a precedent duty, it may or muſt be underſtood with the latitude of all its effects.</hi> And therefore as containing heaven it ſelfe, ſuch is the uſe of it in this place; ſo it is uſed elſewhere vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly;<note place="margin">Hoſea 10.12.</note> to touch but one inſtance, <hi>Sow to your ſelves in righteouſneſſe, breake up the fallow ground, for it is time to ſeeke the Lord, till hee come, and raine righteouſneſſe upon you.</hi> Here raining righteouſneſſe is an effect propoſed to ſeeking the Lord, breaking up barten hearts, and ſowing in righteouſneſſe; here is one righteouſneſſe the reward of another; who can denie in reaſon, this raine of righteouſneſſe to be ſhowres of greater grace and following glory upon their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Like is the uſe of it here, adn therefore we open to its largeſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:111779:20"/>bounds. To ſumme up this parcell, much gaine was from the rod, in that it was fruit iſſuing ſweet and abundant good, but more that this fruit is <hi>Righteouſneſſe.</hi> The name and thing are of divine origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſo that fruit of righteouſneſſe muſt be fruit of God, that is, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent fruit; and two excellencies at leaſt it notes here. 1. Diviue nature, created indeed, and ſuch as is communicable, but exactly conformed to <hi>Jehovah Righteouſneſſe</hi> the very image of it. 2. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine bleſſe, which is the confluence of all glories, communicable alſo, and depending upon this righteouſneſſe derived from God, and roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in him. And is not this excellent fruit? Would any but a beaſt grudge to be whipt into God, into the divine nature, into the image of Chriſt? Who would not be willing to be ſcourged and beaten into heaven, into glory, into life from the wayes of death? Theſe are the ſure gain of chaſtenings, but yet more good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The inſeparable property of this heavenly fruit, is peace; the terme ſeemes to anſwer to the former griefe, vexation, or torture that might be in the rod, which diſquiets the man, and fills the fleſh with pain and trouble, this is but for the preſent, working of Gods phyſick, the <hi>after fruit of righteouſneſſe</hi> brings peace, and ſettles and quiets all again: it is like a ſtomack ſetling cordiall after a tearing vomit. The Syriack reads it by conjunction, the <hi>fruit of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and peace,</hi> not loſing any thing of the gain; yet, me thinkes, not uniting cloſe enough that ſweet paire by a <hi>conjunction,</hi> when the Spirit ſhuts up Peace in Righteouſneſſe, as the inſeparable fruit of that, and ſo makes in a manner one of both, to ſhew their undivided ſocietie: Peace as ſure a fruit of Righteouſneſſe, as righteouſneſſe can be of chaſtening, is Gods own diſcovery,<note place="margin">Iſai. 32.17.</note> 
                     <hi>The work of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall be peace, and the effect of righteouſneſſe, quietneſſe and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for ever.</hi> But what then is this peace? I ſhall not ſtay long in variety of tranſlations of the word to ſearch this,<note place="margin">Pacatum fructum.</note> onely to take the beſt; That is not good that reads paſſively, quieted or appeaſed righteouſneſſe, farre from the word; It is neerer that renders it actively, quieting,<note place="margin">Paciſicum, tranquillum.</note> or pacificall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for it brings peace with it: but neereſt is the abſolute reading of it, as in ours, peaceable, or peacefull righteouſneſſe, abundance, or fulneſſe of peace hath this fruit in the compaſſe of it. But what is it ſtill? I ſhall return in ſhort, as in the generall uſe of it, Peace is the confluence of all good, and therefore points out a proſperous ſtate, when all things are in peace; ſo in the ſpeciall application of it here, it notes all thoſe kinds and degrees of good which onely can
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:111779:21"/>be the cure of the ſeverall evils in the rod: for that way alone looks this peace. Now there be theſe ſore evils uſually in Gods ſcourge. 1. Frownes and diſpleaſure diſcovered in the face of a chaſtiſing God. 2. Smart, and trouble, and vexation upon a ſuffering fleſh. 3. Doubts, and feares, and terrours, ariſing from both the former, in a tender and afflicted ſoul: in all is great bitterneſſe. The fruit of righteouſneſſe, this <hi>peace,</hi> hath ſoveraigne vertue againſt theſee, and cures them all.<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.165.</note> 
                     <hi>Great peace have they which love Gods Law</hi> (ſuch one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are like unto it) <hi>and nothing ſhall offend them:</hi> they ſhall have no ſtumbling-blocks to vex them; great peace iſſuing from that right frame of heart, conforme to Gods Law, takes away all offence, no reigning griefe to ſuch. 1. This turnes frownes of God into ſmiles, and diſpleaſures into pitie, when the rod hath got the victory, and brought home the wanderer to righteouſneſſe; then it is all peace, God frownes no more,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.20.</note> but loves and pities: ſo he ſpeakes to retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Ephraim, It is my deare child, he is my pleaſant ſonne.</hi> Peace then is Gods ſmile and favour fixt on his chaſtened, righteous ſeed. 2. This peace hath a good or vertue in it contrary to all diſeaſes, maladies, or ſores that the rod can make, and therefore muſt carry healing in it; every yoke it eaſeth, and every burden it removeth; it is a ſalve for every ſore, no pain can afflict the fleſh, but peace can eaſe it: This is honour in reproach, ſupply in wants, health in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a guide in wandrings, ſecurity in dangers, reliefe in injuries, life in deaths: this is a ſhelter againſt the ſtorme, and ſhade againſt the ſcorching Sunne; there is no malady whereunto this is not a ſuted remedy, it comforts all ſorrowes, and wipes away all teares from the eyes of Gods chaſtened children.<note place="margin">Pſal. 3.5.6.

                     <hi>He that endureth to the end ſhall be ſaved,</hi> that is, he that abides in bearing, in doing, in working after Gods mind
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:111779:22"/>under the rod, the ſafe fruit of righteouſneſſe, life and peace, ſhall be to that exerciſed ſoule. Thus muſt their labour be ordered. But then what is the worke it ſelfe?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To come to that, Let us diligently conſult the text againe, it is ſaid, they are exerciſed by it, that is, by this chaſtening they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, provoked, and ſtirred up to the worke or exerciſe ſutable to the condition under which they are, and to the end or fruit which they deſire. Now both the Riſe or Incentive to this labour in the rod, and the end of it, which is here expreſſed Righteouſneſſe or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines in God, ſweetly point out unto us together the variety of work that muſt take us up for exerciſe in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>rod</hi> that awakens and puts upon this worke, points us to it, to our ſelves, and unto God for ſpeciall exerciſe; ſo <hi>Holineſſe</hi> unto which chaſtening is intended, no leſſe directs us to looks to the rod, to our ſelves and to God, for ſome ſpeciall worke; if we would bee partakers of it: Hence then wee may gather the exerciſe that doth concerne us is threefold. 1 About the rod that ſmarts. 2 About our hearts that feele. 3 About God that doth inflict and chaſten. 1. Much worke there is to doe about the rod,<note place="margin">Worke about the Rod.</note> if wee expect the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed end, or fruit, it is all taken up in <hi>hearing, bearing,</hi> and <hi>doing</hi> after the rods voice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Hearing-worke.</note> There is <hi>hearing work</hi> for the ſoule; for there is a voyce or ſpeech in every chaſtening, and a ſpeciall duty is it to underſtand the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the rod, which yet cannot be had, without hearkening or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening thereunto: The one is therefore aſſerted a truth from God, and the other commanded a duty to him: upon a wiſe heart that would have profit by chaſtening,<note place="margin">Mich. 6.9</note> 
                     <hi>The Lords voice cryeth to the city</hi> (the wiſe will ſee his name in it) <hi>heare ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</hi> If it be enquired, what voice the rod hath? It is fully replied, The Lords voice cryeth in it: But what is the matter of all this cry? In ſhort, virtually it takes in the whole contents of Gods covenant, and calleth for all reſtipulations due unto God from a covenanted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It is ſpoken of the rod,<note place="margin">Levit. 26.25.</note> which is the ſword; <hi>I will bring a ſword up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, that ſhall avenge the quarrell of my Covenant;</hi> vengeance abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute of wrath it takes up on reprobates for their rebellion, but onely a ſmart exaction or correction of love upon his choſen, to convince them of former errors, and awaken them to future care in obedience to his Covenant. Whether it bee vengeance to one or chaſtening to another, this is certaine, the rod carries in it the voice of Gods whole Covenant, and requires obedience to it, where it comes, God
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:111779:23"/>appoints it for this purpoſe: That one Notion under which <hi>word</hi> and <hi>Rod</hi> are ſignified,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.20.30.</note> even <hi>Judgements,</hi> is enough to evince the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of one to bee carried in the other; The word of covenant is <hi>Judgement,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 14.21.</note> that is, a right word of truth to bring to God, and the rod as <hi>Judgement</hi> alſo a right ſtroke upon the creatures default, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the abuſe of ſo right a covenant. The rod then doth ſpeake, though it be a word in a blow, for God who ſends it; therefore is the chaſtened ſoules duty to heare, that is, to liſten, to ſtudy out: and underſtand, and to beleeve what the Lord ſpeakes in his chaſtenings. But what cryeth the rod more diſtinctly?</p>
                  <p>Theſe three words plainely are uttered in every ſcourge, and muſt be ſo heard, by the wiſe ſoule that would be fruitfull under the rod. 1. The ſtroke cries aloud unto the ſoule, Thou haſt ſinned, thou haſt ſinned; affliction could never fall upon a creature, where ſinne had not made entrance for it: and however God ſeeth not iniquity in <hi>Jacob</hi> ſo as to lay to Iudgement to the rule, to caſt away his people for ever, and forget his covenant of grace to them, yet in every rod hee notes their corruptions to convince of them, to lay ſtrokes of death upon them, and keepe from them for time to come. It was the cry of Iſraels fall before <hi>Ai</hi> to <hi>Joſhua;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joſ. 7.11.</note> 
                     <hi>Iſrael hath ſinned,</hi> and no leſſe <hi>Davids</hi> family troubles and Kingdom ſhakings ſound in his eare, did the matter of <hi>Vriah:</hi> every chaſtening ſpeakes the ſame to Gods Sonnes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another note the whip ſounds out, God is diſpleaſed, God is diſpleaſed: though in love God take up the rod, to keepe his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from the worlds condemnation, yet every ſtroake ſhews a frown upon their ſin: Though <hi>David</hi> be Gods deare, and <hi>Solomon</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved one, and <hi>Ephraim</hi> his joy, yet his diſpleaſure is againſt their ſin. God loves his Saints,<note place="margin">Num. 12.14.</note> but not their ſins, and were he not diſpleaſed he would not ſmile, God ſparing <hi>Miriam</hi> ſhewed that hee loved her, but ſpitting in her face, argues his indignation againſt her folly. Notably doth this appeare,<note place="margin">Pſal 44.24.</note> when the cry of Gods afflicted returnes, Why hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou thy face from us?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The plaine voyce of the rod to the chaſtened ſoule is, <hi>Returne, Returne,</hi> becauſe you ſtrayed abroad, God ſent out his appointed ſcourge after you, to call you home, and to ſet you right in the way of life againe: when <hi>Ephraim</hi> was unruly in this kinde, the ſcourge purſues him, and whips and cries, Come backe <hi>Ephraim,</hi> come backe; and at laſt he heares it,<note place="margin">Jer. 31.18</note> &amp; replies, <hi>Turne me</hi> my God and <hi>I ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Thus every rod cryes repentance to the chaſtened child; and his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:111779:23"/>worke it is to heare, to underſtand, to be convinced, and beleeve all this revelation by the rod, if ever that excellent fruit of righteouſnes appeare.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Bearing-worke.</note> There is <hi>bearing worke</hi> alſo for Chriſtians in reference to the rod; The neceſſity of this patience is urged by one, and the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it adviſed by another Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.36.

                  </p>
                  <p>Three words will direct ſafely.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 1. We muſt beare feelingly, that is, feele and beare, or elſe what patience here? little hope of whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a dry poſt into greene, alas there is neither life nor ſenſe in it, the Anvile-bearing may make worſe and harder, never ſoft nor bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is ſtupidity, not patience, where there is want of ſenſe; no thanke for bearing,<note place="margin">Job 1.20.21.22.</note> where no paine is felt: poore <hi>Iob</hi> feeles and beares, and takes all kindly from the hand of God; in this hee did not ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wee muſt beare freely and willingly; forced ſuffering againſt our wills is not worth the name of patience; over-powered ſtrength may beare in policie, when it muſt yeeld of neceſſity, but little thanks for ſuch a bearing in reſpect of God; to chooſe to beare rather than not, when God chaſtiſeth and his will is ſo, to take up the croſſe, when fleſh might finde the way to ſhift it, Chriſt calling thereunto, this is action, and truth of duty, not dull paſſion, or patience perforce. <hi>Correct me O Lord, and that in judgement,</hi>

No hope of healing the wound, if the plaiſter lye not long enough, nor expectation of harveſt by the husbandman, till winter bee paſt and the ſeaſon come: thus beare the rod, and the rod ſhall beare his pretious fruit.</p>

                  <p>In generall, to glorifie God, or give glory to him, cannot be by adding any thing to him, but by acknowledging and manifeſting the fundamentall glory that is in him.<note place="margin">Glorificare eſt clarificare. Auguſtin.</note> Now the glory of God, is his excellencie, wherein hee out-reacheth, or over-commeth all created being; as his excellencie of Power,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:111779:26"/>excellencie of wiſedome, excellencie of holineſſe, of majeſtie, of juſtice, and of goodneſſe, is that which is unparallel'd, that cannot be matcht, and therefore truly glory: were this given unto God, that is, manifeſted to the world to be in him by his people, in their ſutable demeanour to ſuch a glory by their words, duties, wayes, and converſations, while it is peace, our feet might be kept from ſtumbling upon the dark mountaines. But when creatures deny this,<note place="margin">Ier. 13.16.</note> how juſt is it for that glorious majeſtie to require it by his rod? and now it muſt be yeelded, or we yeeld our ſelves to perdition. His glory he will have, and we muſt thus aſcribe it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By abaſing, abhorring, and nullifying our ſelves as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be, who have lifted up a word or thought againſt ſuch a glory. Impudent pride of heart is in creatures, while they ſet their ſin above God, which they doe, when they obey it in the luſts of it; obedience is a debt to glory, and is there glory in ſinne, poore man, that thou ſhouldeſt obey it? or is there none in God, that thou denieſt it him? Is ſhame become glory, and glory ſhame? Thy ſin thy God, and thy God ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer in thy thoughts then ſin? O abhorre thy ſelfe in duſt and aſhes,<note place="margin">Iob 42.5.6.</note> that God may yet be glorified in thee. <hi>Job</hi> was never right untill he came to this paſſe, <hi>I have heard thee by the hearing of the eare, but now mine eye ſeeth thee; wherefore I abhorre my ſelfe, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> Goe we muſt as low, and let God be exalted in our abaſement.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By juſtifying God in all the wayes of his judgements, and proceedings againſt his creatures;<note place="margin">Lam. 3.39.</note> if man ſuffer for his ſin, as who doth not? why doth living man complaine? Yet ſee what ſots ſin makes us, to provoke the Lord to jealouſie, and then quarrell with him for being angry, &amp; ſo ſpoile him twice of his glory: Learn, learn, poore ſoule, of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> though his ſpan-long thoughts could not reach Gods exquiſite procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in his judgements, yet this he laies down as undeniable, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ier. 12.1.</note> Or learn of <hi>David,</hi> Againſt thee, thee onely have I ſinned, &amp;c. <hi>that thou mightſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt,</hi>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:111779:26"/>and it is righteous: yet this is mercy, my juſt recompenſe is Hell; Thus ſhould chaſtiſed ſinners glorifie their God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By a ſutable demeanour toward the glory of Gods being, eſpecially now under the rod: deepeſt trembling to higheſt Majeſtie, greateſt feare to Supreme Holineſſe, fulleſt obedience to greateſt Power, ſtrongeſt faith to glorious Truth, and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt love to Excelling goodneſſe are equall matches, if man bee judge; All wee are are and have, and can, is but his debt, who gave all this, and is more then all to our poore Soule.<note place="margin">Deut. 6.5.</note> No leſſe can ſuch a glory crave than all the heart, and all the Soule, and all the mind, and all the might; and yet our all too little for the leaſt of him. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> began to ſtudy this at laſt, when ſhame was fallen on him, to honour God, it is beſt at firſt: Aime at this, ſtrive for this, Gods glory is our trueſt gaine.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. In this <hi>afterward</hi> is carried the <hi>order</hi> of this fruits appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it ſucceedes, not foregoes, it is after, not before the paine and Chriſtian exerciſe under it: folly would brand that hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, who expects his crop, before he till, or winter bee over; and madneſſe in that Chriſtian who lookes for peace, before his exerciſe performed and rod removed: It was the method God keepes with his owne Sonne (not in way of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening, unleſſe the chaſtiſement of our peace) he muſt firſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,

                  <p n="2">2. In this <hi>afterward</hi> is intended <hi>ſpeede,</hi> that is, ſoone after, or immediatly after labour this fruit is return'd; The travelling womans paine after labouring through ſome throwes, brings forth the child anon; it is at the very heeles of her travaile: (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be a croſſe birth, whereof no feare in preſent caſe) ſo ſoone comes fruit of grace and peace upon the Chriſtians tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile under the rod; atleaſt the beginnings or firſt fruit, though not the full expected harveſt.<note place="margin">Iſa. 66.7.8.</note> It is a ſweet propheticall note, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the miraculous and fruitful return of the Iewes to Chriſt, after their long rejection and many paines, when they beginne to exerciſe and labour under the rod and word indeede, <hi>As ſoone as Zion travelled, ſhe brought forth her children,</hi> Nay if that be not ſoone enough after, take a neerer expreſſion, <hi>Before ſhee travelled ſhe brought forth, before her paine came, ſhe was delivered of a man child:</hi> Then ſhee neede not ſtay to labour: but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it rightly, it is an expreſſion, that noteth ſpeede in fruit-bearing, yet not excluding paine in the due labour of the Church; but a rhetoricall phraſe it is to ſet forth the ſwiftnes of the flocking of the Iews to Chriſt, as afterwards, <hi>Shall a nation be borne at once?</hi>

It is firmly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the text, Chaſtening yeelds this fruit, which that wee may take aright, two things are to bee remembred concerning chaſtening. 1 The materiall part of it, which is nothing but the ſmart. 2 The formall part, and that is the ſpirit of the rod, or the ſpirituall energie, which it receiveth from that <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>power, holineſſe,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> that uſeth it toward the children of his boſome; when therfore we ſpeake of chaſtening it is meant the <hi>Reſult</hi> of both theſe, not ſmart abſtracted, nor ſpirit ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, but both united in this chaſtening and of this it is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, <hi>It yeeldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſſe;</hi> and in the particulars following I ſhall ſhew you how. 1 Orderly, for as there are many ingredients in this chaſtening, Smart, and Love, and Spirit; It is Spirit that is active, working this good unto the creature, for Spirit muſt be in the cauſe, if Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit bee the effect: Now this mighty ſpirit workes through ſmart, and through love to bring forth this fruit, yet in this method, obſerving theſe ſteps. 1 Through the paine and griefe upon the fleſh, as by its inſtrument it works priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to take away ſtubbornneſſe and indiſpoſition unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; true, ſmart it ſelfe doth rather anger, but ſpirit and ſmart will make men yeeld. This chaſtening knocks downe rebellion, weakens corruption, takes away gaineſaying to the will of God; for there is the ſpirit that overpowers, and the ſmart that in bitters ſinne unto the fleſh, ſo that it becomes wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave the dug though its delight, when nothing but
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:111779:28"/>wormwood is taſted in it. This ſpirituall effect of chaſtening, lieth in that promiſe,<note place="margin">Eſa. 27.9.</note> 
                     <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and this is all the fruit to take away his ſinne.</hi> Spirit in paine doth this firſt. 2. Poſitively, by love and ſmart it drawes to God, and formes the fruits of love and purpoſe of the rod up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heart. Now that love of the Father that doth chaſtiſe, carries all the effects of grace in it, righteouſneſſe is but his love, and peace his love, and life his love, that is, the iſſues of it, and the rod makes way through the fleſh to bring theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule, and the Spirit through both perfects the effect, and leaves Gods image more eminently ſtampt upon the heart, that more exactly we might ſubject our ſelves to the Father of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and live.<note place="margin">Luke 15.17. Ier. 31.18.

Thus then conceive the way of this increaſe; the Spirit by his power ſtrikes out this bloom and fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through the dry rod; that is but the ſtalke, yet ſuch a ſtalk there muſt be, the Spirit is the ſeminall vertue that gives forth the fruit; and in this order, by the ſmart awing, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling purging an untoward fleſh, and by love adjoyned draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conforming the ſoule to God, ſo making righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and peace to abound.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Freely doth this rod thus give the fruit; the very word imports it, yeelding it from it ſelfe: No green tree yeelds its fruit more naturally, none ſo freely as this: For <hi>Grace</hi> is in it, which every way is free, and works moſt freely toward the creature. Nothing more free then gift, and that gift the freeſt, which comes onely from and for the Donors ſelfe. Thus the love of God, through the rod, gives forth this gain: it is not by force, nor charm, that this dry rod is quickned, and made fruitfull, onely by Grace and Promiſe, becauſe the chaſtiſing father ſaith,<note place="margin">Hoſea 5.15.</note> I will afflict, and <hi>they ſhall ſeek me early.</hi> It is not for thy exerciſe, but to thy exerciſe, that the Lord commands his rod to yeeld this bleſſed fruit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Certainly ſhall this fruit be rendred from the Rod, to the exerciſed ſoule: It is not doubtfully delivered, it may yeeld, or it may not, but peremptorily affirmed, it doth yeeld. If the power, promiſe, or truth of the Father
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:111779:29"/>of ſpirits, can give certainty enough, all is put to it to aſſure this fruit. He that workes, and none can let it, hath thus ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,<note place="margin">Iſai. 48.11.</note> 
                     <hi>For mine owne ſake, even for mine owne ſake, will I doe it.</hi> What will he doe? Even refine his people, and make them choice ones in the Furnace of Afflictions, righteous and glorious; nay, it ſtands him upon, otherwiſe his Name would bee polluted, and his glory loſt, in his Churches bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe under the Rod. From all the premiſed explications we muſt take the ſtate of the truth concluded; the ſum where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is this, Gods chaſtenings, his ſmarting loving Rods for the afterward yeeld, that is, in their appointed time and manner, give the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſſe, both grace and bliſſe to them that are duly exerciſed by them.

The alone decree and ordinance of that great God, whoſe counſell none can croſſe, hath ſo linked this chaſtening cauſe to this effect, and this condition, and this ſeaſon, that they cannot bee ſeparated.

Senſuall judgement upon Gods dealings, miſguides men to perverſe thoughts of Gods rod, and lets looſe paſſion, and whets the tongue againſt the Almighty; Thus they tumble in the net, and are faſter taken, and murmure themſelves into greater torture: for God will have the maſtery, and whip his own out of ſenſuall raſhnes and complaints. I note this for the profit of Gods own in this day of darkneſſe; ſenſe never deals well with Gods word, nor with his rod; lay that aſide, rectifie your thoughts of the preſent troubles on the Church by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; let faith looke through the providence which now cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeth us, it will diſcover the after part of it to be very good, ſo full of glory to Gods people that they would not avoid the ſmart, to loſe the gaine. Eaſe and deliverance in this caſe, would be ſpurn'd away by a beleeving ſoul. It was Iſraels ſin to live by ſenſe, to murmure in ſtraits, to be barren in mercies. Unhappy ſenſe, unhappy men that live by it! Senſe makes Murmurers, Beggers and Apoſtates from God in time of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:111779:30"/>trouble; but faith makes Martyrs, gainers, and fruitfull, praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full admirers of God in fiery tryalls: beleeve throughly, and then judge aright of Gods chaſtening providence.</p>

                  <p>IN all this Concatenation of Rod, Fruit, Exerciſe and Time, there is but one thing that concerns us as duty, wherein, if we fail, all the reſt are ſcattered, and become vain; True it is, Gods hand muſt temper rod and love, to make a chaſtening; and he muſt bleſſe this chaſtening to produce kindly fruit, righteouſneſſe and Peace, and time or ſeaſon in his power, but his ordinance calls in our exerciſe, as an indiſpenſable duty, wherein we are to expect this bleſſed gain, and without which we ſhall be but as the barren field, and dry heath, neerer to a curſe then a bleſſing, fit for nothing but the fire.</p>
                  <p>To this noble Chriſtian Exerciſe then under the Rod, is the work now to perſwade men, neceſſity lyeth on us to be doing, either to eſcape (otherwiſe inevitable) deſtruction, or to gain that ſweet and deſired fruit intailed on Gods chaſtening. As for the matter of the duty, not needleſly to repeat, learn it in the premiſed draught of the work: There is, hearing, bearing, doing-work about the Rod, there is conſidering, judging, breaking, bowing-work about the heart, and that great buſineſſe of all, giving glory unto God. And in all theſe, if we exerciſe aright, our labour muſt be hard, even in our ſhirts, and frequent, every day muſt we be at it, and conſtant, no giving over untill the fruit come.</p>
                  <p>But alas,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> what fleſh and blood can indure thus to labour in the fires? Who can ſet about that <hi>Rod-work, heart-work, God-work,</hi> when he is under the laſh, and no reſt in the bones, nor eaſe in the fleſh?</p>

Now the main ſtrength this ſting hath to ſtrike and hurt, and torment,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.56.</note> is from the <hi>Law;</hi> it is expreſly ſo averred, the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of ſin is the <hi>Law;</hi> The Law? doth that ſtrengthen ſin? yea, but not ſinfully; not by adding any thing of the ſame kinde, to make it more ſin, but by aggravating the ſinfulneſſe of it, to make it more pain and terror: Thus the Law ſtrengthens ſin to vex the ſoule in theſe ſeverall wayes. 1. By making it ſin; for without the Law, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is a breach, ſin were not; where there is no Law, there can be no tranſgreſſion, at leaſt none to be imputed: but now the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.13.</note> and that in abſolute holineſſe, rectitude and goodneſſe, it makes every tranſgreſſion abſolutely vile, corrupt and ſinfull; yea, ſinfulneſſe in the abſtract, the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> the <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>hell</hi> of ſin; it can be no leſſe, being extremely oppoſite to the very <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>heaven</hi> of holineſſe in the Law, and this muſt make the ſcourge ſtrike like a Scorpion to torturing and aſtoniſhment: how terrible is it, meerly to ſuffer as evill doers with ſin upon us?</p>
                  <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.7, 8, 9, 10.</note> The Law ſtrengthens ſin to vex, by making known the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it to the conſcience: <hi>I had not known ſin,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, but by the Law; and again, <hi>by the Law is the knowledge of ſin:</hi> and ſuch a glance it was the Law gave him, that he was dead with the ſight of it,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.20.</note> 
                     <hi>Sin revived,</hi> and <hi>I died;</hi> It is torment for a man to ſuffer with his guilt caſt in his face, written upon his fore-head, and ſtrucken to his heart; no marvell if that ſoule faint.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> And yet further the Law ſtrengthens ſin to torment a ſoule in affliction, by diſcovering the wrath from whence it comes, the curſe of God that hath whet and ſharpened it, to wound deadly, and that it is but the earneſt of ſeventie times ſeven plagues more to come upon it for ſin: Now dreadfull is this condition. Alas, what ſoul

Surely none; care then muſt be, that this ſting and ſtrength of the Rod be deſtroyed, if ever a ſoule be fitted for that great exerciſe under Gods chaſtening. Again, there is beſides this another life, and ſtrength of ſin in the fleſh, where it lives natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: As a man is ſaid to be living in or by the Law, when it acquits him, and condemnes him not to take away his life, yet he is naturally alive alſo, by the principles of life within him; ſo ſin is alive by the Law, when it is made ſtrong thereby to condemne and kill the man; yet it's naturall, rooted life, whence all the motions and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings come, are in the fleſh;<note place="margin">Rom. 7.23, 24</note> of which no leſſe is the Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, in bemoaning that Law that wars in his members, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf a wretched man, untill he be freed from that body, wherein raigne only ſin and death.

This is actually done by Chriſt; as for the time of the actuall manifeſtation of this ſin in his united members, more wil be declared in the application of this vertue of Chriſt hereafter; but for preſent ſome help is given from hence to conceive of the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and neceſſity of ſins fall by the death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Yet the difficulty is not cleared, How ſhould croſſe, or blood, or death, theſe dead things, work the fall or death of ſin in my
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:111779:38"/>fleſh and ſpirit? The laſt poſition will come home to this: There is a living ſpirit purchaſed, given, and annexed unto all theſe ſaving works of Chriſt, which applies the vertue of his death, ſufferings, and reſurrection, to produce ſutable and due effects upon mans ſoule: This, this is that active principle that ſets Chriſt death on work to kill ſin, that brings men to a fellowſhip of his ſufferings, and makes them conformable to his death. The vaſt difference between blood and blood, death and death, together with the ground of it, is fully declared by the Apoſtle in comparing the legall ſacrifices with Chriſts one perfect offering,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.9.13, 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Alas the blood of Buls and Goats could,</hi> but at beſt, <hi>ſanctifie to the purifying of the fleſh, it could never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect concerning the conſcience, but the blood of Chriſt purgeth conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God,</hi> which is the ſame with killing ſin within us, and freeing our hearts from the bendage of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that glorious liberty in ſerving God. But what makes the difference, that ſo worthleſſe, this to excell for purging ſin? The ſame Text will ſatisfie: <hi>It was the blood of him, who through the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Spirit, offered himſelfe without ſpot or fault to God;</hi> wherein theſe excellencies are obſervable. 1. It was a pure blood, without any poyſonous tincture of ſin by participation, therefore a remedy fitted againſt it, ſuch is no blood of creatures beſides, but all, either by inheritance, or participation, defiled. 2. It was a powerfull, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited blood, for that eternall Spirit, by which he offered himſelfe, works in it and by it, to purge conſciences from Spirituall death of ſin, but the other to a weak ſpiritleſſe blood, therefore altogether uſeleſſe for theſe high effects; No ſope nor nitre, no fire nor blood materiall can work out ſin, no ſpirit in theſe; only that <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> ſope,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.2.</note> and that <hi>Refiners</hi> fire, and that <hi>Sacrificers</hi> blood can purge from ſins powerfull pollutions, into which the eternall Spirit gives influence, and whereby it works ſins perpetuall deſtruction. It is not obſcure, that our Lord, upon leaving the world, deſignes his Spirit in his own place, to put his Church in remembrance of what he hath told them, to ſhew them the things of Chriſt in the power of them, and to bring home the ſpirituall energie and force of all his ſatisfaction, death and reſurrection to their ſoules; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore the death of Chriſt be the plague of ſin, when wee come to feel the vertue of this death, we muſt by the Spirit mortifie the deeds of our fleſh,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> by yeelding to that Spirits effectuall appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this killing power to our indwelling corruptions.

                  <p n="1">1. In anſwering the Spirit to his worke of union; for as that from Chriſt takes hold of us, ſo faith in us moved by the Spirit takes hold of him, whereby the ſoule is actually united to him, and by this union made partaker of all ſaving vertue in him, therfore of the power of his death.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.20.</note> Hence it is ſaid, that <hi>we are ingrafted into Chriſt by faith,</hi> and no leſſe that <hi>Chriſt dwels in our be arts by faith.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.17.</note> Now the work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto faith moves us in this matter, is to yeeld to the Spirits offer, and to cloſe with Chriſt as members, whom he reveales as ſent of God to be our head, and ſo with him to become one Chriſt myſticall; thus our minds by faith are moved to cloſe with him by apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, knowing and acknowledging him to be our head, our wills by chooſing him, and yeelding to him as head, and our hearts by faith alſo cleaving to him as head, in loving, fearing, and delighting in him; thus by conſent of faith are we brought to union with Chriſt, and thereby to communion in all his fulneſſe; whence we draw from his death that fruit which his death doth yeeld, and from his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that good which it carrieth for us; and in a word, from him thus we have grace for grace: as the graft ſucks out the juice and fatneſſe of the good Olive.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In anſwering to the Spirits worke of revelation, faith is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, which faith doth and indeed onely can doe by making evident and reall to the ſoule, what the Spirit by the word reveals:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:111779:39"/>Now indeed the greateſt works of the Goſpel on mens hearts are effected by revelation, the Goſpels light hath a mighty influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ſaving effects, Nothing of grace is wrought in a ſoule but by light, this works life and all to men. To the preſent caſe, the Spirit reveales Jeſus Chriſt the compleat ſalvation to his people, his death the plague of their ſin, his reſurrection the cauſe of their life to God, and therefore a neceſſity of dying and living with him; this revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being made evident &amp; reall by faith unto a ſoule, becomes not a <hi>Platonicall Idea,</hi> or vaine ſpeculation, but an over-powering truth, working it ſelfe into the heart and moulding it into its owne like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of death or life. The power of ſuch revelation is eminently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred by a mighty Apoſtle, that was once a bitter enemy to the Goſpel, yet thus he ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.15.</note> 
                     <hi>When it pleaſed God to reveale his Sonue in me, immediately I conferred not with fleſh and bloud;</hi> It was ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, being evidenced by faith, that it preſently takes him from all carnall conſiderations, knits him ſo faſt to Chriſt, that fleſh &amp; bloud can never take him off; ſomewhat like that fiery charret that ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated <hi>Elijah</hi> from <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and took him unto God: indeed ſuch fire there is as well as light, in theſe revelations realized by faith. And that this is faiths ſerviceable worke to the Spirit ſo to evidence is cleare enough, when it is ſtyled the Evidence of things not ſeen,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> faith will convince, when no light els can move: The Spirit of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore meeting with faith,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.17.19.</note> leaves great and mighty works upon that ſoule, no leſſe than the might of the power of God revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them can effect. Such is that in the preſent inſtance, when the Spirit revealing and faith evidencing the death of Chriſt to be ſinnes deſtruction, the ſoule is hereby leſt dead unto ſin. Let faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worke upon this revelation to evidence it, that the minde may diſcerne it, and heart reſt upon it, the life of ſin will ſurely fall, as the hearts of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the ſight of <hi>Goliah,</hi> or as the man dyes at the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the Cockatrices eye.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith ſerves the Spirit to bring in the vertnes of Chriſt upon the ſoule, in anſwering its application and direction concerning this matter, by receiving one and obeying the other, which being fitted for this inſtrument, none but faith can anſwer. It hath been declared before that the maine worke of bringing chriſt and his excellencies into the ſoule, is upon the hand of Gods mighty Spirit; This unites to him, and reveales the force of him, and by its ſpirituall energie gives or applies him intirely for life, and every piece of him for the ſeverall effects of grace, with command ſo to receive him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:111779:40"/>the revealed force or vertue from him; Now nothing but faith can ſute the anſwer, this onely receives what the Spirit gives, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyes what the Spirit commands, and ſo doing makes the ſoule have actuall experience of all that good of Chriſt miniſtred by his Spirit; So that the obedientiall act of faith in receiving Chriſt as he is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in eying of him, and depending on him, as the onely ſalvation of his people, is the onely way of faith to draw ſalvation from him. So the like work of faith upon his death, to evidence it the onely baine of ſin in our fleſh, ſo to receive it in mind and will and heart, and reſt on it onely for this effect, is the way to find the deſired iſſue, even the death of ſin in our fleſh. To them therfore who are puzzeld with that queſtion, How faith ſhould draw vertue out of Chriſt or his death, I ſhould onely reply, (premiſing that union with him, and evidence of him foreſpoken) it is by an obedientiall receiving the truth of him, and reſting on it to be made good by the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, upon which reception all the benefits of perſon, death and life, are conferred by the arme of God upon that ſoule.

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. It muſt be a full eye of Faith alſo, that receiveth this vertue from Chriſt; that is, Faith gathering it's full force, turning all the thoughts of the minde, all the purpoſes and reſolutions of the will, and all the affections of the heart to cloſe with Chriſt in his dying, and to draw vertue thence conformable thereunto, even death to ſin; ſuch an ey, when all the ſpirits in the ſoul give their joynt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence unto it, muſt needs have a piercing ſight; ſuch as Chriſt muſt, and will yeeld unto: with ſuch a full Spirit of Faith came that woman to touch the hem of Chriſts garment, and ſutably drew ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue out of him for ſtopping the iſſue of blood; Neither was it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly her drawing againſt the knowledge and will of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.21.</note> that did this, but his free giving out vertue from himſelf unto that full Faith, which made her ſay: <hi>If I may but touch his garment, I ſhall be whole.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="3">3. TO the ſoule that would be induſtrious in keeping cloſe to this ſpirituall exerciſe under chaſtening, the laſt word that I ſhould give for help is, <hi>To eye the Mediator of the rod, and make ſure of him to be ſiding with it.</hi> Jeſus the Son of God the Mediator of the Covenant, mediates alſo for his in reſpect of the rod, to make this worke together with that, for the eternall good and comfort of his choſen; There is no paſſage of providence from God to us, but it comes through the hand of a Mediator;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.6.</note> 
                     <hi>All things</hi> are therefore ſaid to <hi>be by</hi> him, and among thoſe <hi>all,</hi> chaſtenings of his people muſt fall in; O ſweet and bleſſed rod that falls upon any poore ſoule, through its Mediators hand; it cannot be evill, but good unto him. The very notion of a Mediator is full of ſweetneſſe; Some ſmattering light of this, <hi>that it is beſt to have to doe with God through a Mediator,</hi> ſome of the Gentiles had,<note place="margin">Heroes, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moues, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra, Mediantes dignitates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</note> for which in their way they canonized ſuch as they conceived to be Heroicall Spirits while they lived, to be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites of the High-gods when they died, by whom they expected to draw downe ſome favours upon themſelves. But the true light of God gives us to know, <hi>one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him,</hi> one <hi>Lord Mediator</hi> indeed, Jehovah is in him, fulneſſe and goodneſſe of beeing, and that <hi>(quatenus)</hi> in the very reſpect of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, that by Mediation he might bring downe all from the higheſt God to the loweſt creature: Now put what you will into the hand and power of a Mediator, it muſt turne to good unto them, for whom he hath undertaken this Mediation; His hand intends nothing els but help to the weaker part, for whom he mediates, as it obtaines
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:111779:43"/>nothing but grace from the mighty God, to whom he miniſters for them. Take we this inſtance; Nothing could be more contrary and hurtfull to Man a ſinner than the Law, that found him guiltie, and accordingly curſed him to death;<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> yet this <hi>ordained in the hand of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> though but an Earthly one, muſt be revealed with Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call purpoſes; the hand or Miniſtry of a Mediator, muſt needs be gracious; how much more the hand of that heavenly Mediator, wherein is power and grace it ſelfe (more than commonly miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall) can and will turne all within its reach, ſcourgings themſelves to the comfort of Gods chaſtened ones? Now nothing clearer than this, that the rod as well as Covenant is in his hand, therefore over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled, and tempered by him for the afflicteds comfort: He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the ſpirit of the rod, and he takes out the ſting of it. Raviſh him with the piercings of the ſingle eye of faith, and you are ſure of him your Mediator, and he ſure ſo to order afflictions for good, that they ſhall not preſſe you out of your working frame. Two ſpeciall mediating helpes are obſervable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Mediator ſteps in between wrath and us, to interdict that; no fury nor effects of it, can iſſue from God upon the people of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation; he ſuffers nothing but love to proceed toward them, and if that love bring the rod to try or purge, he yet againe interpoſeth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hold off the ſmart, or to allay it that it ſhall not diſtract: no affliction comes but he ſweetens and meekens it. The rage of man could not aggravate a torment more,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.19, 26, 27.</note> than that proud Monarch did in his ſeven times over-heated fornace, for thoſe three valiant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the true God; yet throwne in and comming out, the ſmell of fire was not upon them, nor a finge upon their cloaths. How came this to paſſe? There was a fourth went in with them, and ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and harme, the Son of God, whoſe hand maſter'd and cool'd the fire; The Mediator ſweetens the Croſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Mediator as he ſteps in againſt the rod, ſo for us, as to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the bitternes of that, ſo to ſtrengthen our weakneſſe for bearing the remaining ſmart. It is marvellous that a creature ſhould doe and ſuffer that ſo triumphingly, which the Apoſtle profeſſeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;<note place="margin">Phil. 4.11, 12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>I have learned in what ever ſtate I am, therewith to be content.</hi> He was able contentedly to goe on in his worke, under the hardeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, not content onely with a little, but whether he have any thing or nothing, it is all one with him, he hath ſufficiency within him; He can <hi>be abaſhed,</hi> and <hi>be hungry,</hi> and <hi>ſuffer need,</hi> and nothing turnes him out of his biaſſe to the worke of God. How comes he to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:111779:43"/>be ſo unſhaken? He tells us, <hi>I can doe all things thorough Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me.</hi> It was the Mediator that ſupported, putting his own neck into the yoke, &amp; his own ſhoulder to the burden, that it might not over-charge this poore ſoule. Let us eye him, and overcome him by looking in faith to him as Mediator; he cannot deny but he will doe for us likewiſe. With a carefull eye to theſe directions, we may reach the marke that is ſet before us, even in the midſt of roaring Seas, tumultuous preſſures, ſcorching fires, and heart-breaking bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, to give glory unto God, our bleſſing ſhall not then be far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the fruit of righteouſneſſe and peace, with abundant following conſolations.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. XII.</hi> Conſolations iſſuing from the precedent Truth.</head>
                  <p>AS the Conſolations of Chriſt are ſweet and many, in varietie of conditions, ſo in none more ſweet and abundant, than in the ſtate of ſufferings; the abundance of theſe brings forth plentie of them. It is worth our view to ſee what ſtore of them, the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the rod with its appendents in the preſent truth, ſends forth to Gods afflicted; It will be very injurious to hide them from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed wraſtlers under Gods rod, ſeeing he hath ordained them for ſuch; though perhaps they may receive a pinch upon the thigh, that makes them halt, yet they ſhall not goe away without a bleſſing; Though God whip them, yet will he bleſſe them. Every word in the Text ſpeaks comfort unto theſe, and no man may take it from them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The hand of love that chaſtens, as a Father cheers up the ſoules labouring in the furnace; Faint not poore heart, when thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked, my dear, my darling, the child of my delights art thou;<note place="margin">Jer. 31, 20.</note> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee when I ſpeake againſt thee, every ſtroke goes to my heart, my bowells are troubled for thee, and I will ſurely have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on thee. I delight not to afflict, but now it is needfull, becauſe I love I chaſten you, and chaſten that I may ſave you;<note place="margin">Rev. 3.19.</note> better chaſtened than condemned; Let not ſorrow over-lay your hearts, God-love cannot afflict his ſeed for evill.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The rod it ſelfe that ſmites them, ſpeaks nothing but good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; ſcare not, thou toſſed and afflicted ſoule,<note place="margin">Pſal. 23.4.</note> behold I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee: although I ſmart and wound the fleſh, yet it is but to heale the Spirit, my commiſſion is to awaken, not to ſtun thee, to kill thy ſin, not to hurt thy ſoule, to refine and not conſume thee, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy droſſe, and make thy gold more glorious. Lift up thy head,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:111779:44"/>I am from God on thy ſide, to ſave not to deſtroy; Love hath ſent me, to check ſin, and ſpur on grace, to turne thee out of the wayes of death, and keep thee in the paths of life; Had not I come, how many luſts would have preyed upon thee? How many deaths might have devoured thee? How would hell have ſtriven to ſwallow thee? I am Gods Scepter to over-power thee, as well as his rod to diſcipline and guide thee to heaven. Be not diſconſolate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The work it ſelfe, though hard and irkeſome in the very fires, yet yeelds ſweet comforting ſuggeſtions to the chaſtened and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed ſoule. Three grounds of conſolation at leaſt may hence be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, to incourage the afflicted heart.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is life above affliction, when the rod hinders not from motion unto God: Miſerable he that can neither ſet hand to worke, nor feet to walk in the valley of trouble; but bleſſed, whoſe heart is not falne, nor turn'd aſide from the work of God, amidſt all bluſters: Happy <hi>Job</hi> that could give glory by beleeving unto God,<note place="margin">Job 13.15.</note> though he ſhould kill him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is ſtrength of grace in that ſoule, which can ſo maſter the rod, as not to be diſquieted by it from its appointed worke: As it argues ſmall ſtrength for the heart to faint in the day of affliction, ſo it no leſſe evidenceth great power not to be ſhaken.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a reward certainly following after, and that a ſweet and full one.<note place="margin">Jer. 31.16.</note> It was <hi>Rachels</hi> conſolation, <hi>Refraine thine eyes from teares, thy worke ſhall be rewarded.</hi> No worſe the iſſue of all Gods chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; It is ſweet to live the life of God above afflictions; It is hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to be of the Worthies, and mightie ones of God, to doe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently; Its greateſt gaine to have Gods reward; Himſelfe is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne; <hi>I am thy Shield,</hi>

                     <hi>and thy exceeding great reward,</hi> was his word to travelling <hi>Abraham;</hi> and no leſſe his voice to the ſoules labouring faithfully under his rod. Be comforted then ye chaſtened of the Lord, life and honour and riches are yours, if God can ſatisfie you; your worke ſhall be well rewarded, then be comforted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The promiſed end and certain iſſue both of the fathers ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of thy laborious exerciſe under the rod, conclude infallibly ſweet conſolation to thy ſoule: Three expreſſions in the text which carry in them the gaine of affliction, are very cordiall, and worth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to the heavy heart.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Fruit is intailed upon Gods rod, and thy worke; which iſſuing from God in this line, is a notion of good &amp; not of evill, and ſounds abundance, &amp; not ſcanty meaſure of this ſweet, that doth ariſe from
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:111779:44"/>bitter; It is ſome comfort to know a mans end ſhall be good, though his beginning and way be darke and evill. Woe to him whoſe good ſhall end in evil, and joy in ſorrow, but bleſſed he whoſe ſorrow ſhall be turned to joy, and teares finiſhed in laughing: Good, much good is reſerved for thee in the latter end, thou afflicted of the Lord; doubled ſweet had <hi>Job</hi> for all his ſowre, and ſo ſhalt thou,<note place="margin">Job 42.12.</note> let not preſent ſorrow ſwallow up thy hopefull comforts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Righteouſneſſe, the ſpeciall kinde of this fruit, if ſerious thoughts work on it, muſt inlarge thy heart, and heighten thy joy againſt all ſmart, whatever it coſt thee: It is of the kinde of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and heavenly good, not low, viſible and earthy, all which muſt periſh: This is a piece of Gods holineſſe, whereof by chaſtening he intends to make us ſharers with himſelf; this is fruit, this is good indeed: This heavenly rectitude helpt on in mans heart by chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is the face or Image of God in a mirror, the divine nature car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in it the whole Set of Graces, anſwering to the Graces of Chriſt, and Attributes of God; none ſo neer God as theſe in reality of nature, and dignity of place; Theſe are in the Spirits expreſſes, the heavenly Gold, Pearles, Diamonds, Agats, Carbuncles, Rubies, &amp;c. Bleſſed ſoule that is fraught with ſuch riches! what will one ſcruple of ſaving faith, of true holineſſe, &amp;c. be worth, when God comes to ſeek his Jewels? Beggarly world ſhall then be ſhut out, no worth in the Gold of <hi>Havilah</hi> or <hi>Ophir,</hi> only excellency will be in the Gold of Heaven, a little righteouſneſſe more worth then a world, and thou, poore chaſtened of the Lord, ſhalt have fruit, a whole crop, and abundance of this, whileſt thou laboureſt in the fires to glorifie the Lord; He will inrich, and honour, and comfort thee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If there be not good enough in that heavenly kinde of fruit to comfort thee, (excellent, becauſe it is righteouſneſſe, the face of God, a ſpark from heaven) take in it's adjunct or ſweet aſſociate <hi>Peace,</hi> that clings unto, and kiſſeth the righteous ſoule. This is the bleſſing that cannot be denyed thee, thou chaſtened of the Lord, <hi>Peace be unto thee:</hi> The Lord himſelfe ſpeaks it unto thee,<note place="margin">John 14.27.</note> the God of Peace; Chriſt bequeathes it, the Prince of Peace, <hi>My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,</hi> even to his troubled and afflicted Diſciples; and the Spirit of peace ſeales it upon your hearts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the only Comforter in Chriſts ſtead to be alwayes preſent, quieting and comforting the hearts of his diſtreſſed members: Nay, the Rod it ſelf ſpeaks peace, and not evill; nay, if thou wilt look up and ſee the goodneſſe of God in his ſcourge, thy heart muſt, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:111779:45"/>ſhall ſay truly, It is peace, God ſmiles on me whileſt he whips me, my ſmart is allayed, my feares are gone; perfect love ſhines forth in chaſtening, Why ſhould I be afraid? God ownes and holds mee, though his hand be heavie upon me; he calls mee darling, childe of his delights, when he ſeems to caſt me off; he rebukes mee indeed ſharply, yet hee remembers mee; hee ſtrikes, yet his bowels are troubled for me; he hath afflicted, but hee will ſure have mercy on me; I will therefore cheerfully beare his hand, becauſe it is good, and comfort my ſelf in my ſorrowes, and ſing to my God in the very fires; for the fruit of righteouſneſſe and peace ſhall be with me for ever. My God and Father ſaith ſo, my Redeemer ſaith ſo, my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter ſaith ſo, yea, my afflictions ſay ſo, and therefore my heart is perſwaded to aſſent, and ſay, Surely it is ſo: Peace is my ſolace in the midſt of ſufferings, though the world ſee it not; Conſider, and be comforted, yee chaſtened ones.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:111779:45"/>the greatneſſe of our outward evill argue infallibly, the abſence of Gods love, or the preſence of his wrath? This is the queſtion, which to take for granted, is a great miſtake, the Negative part of it is Gods known Truth, otherwiſe caſt <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> yea, the Sonne of God in the fleſh, (whom it pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bruiſe or grinde with grief; ſo that his evils named him the Man of ſorrowes) out of the number of his darlings: For in the generations of men, who have felt heavier ſtrokes, or more bitter pangs in body or ſpirit? yet the Lord was with all theſe, and though he grievouſly afflicted, yet hee hated them not; his love and pity was with his holy ones. To ſatisfie this caſe, three evidences of Gods love I ſhall ſhew alwayes with his in their greateſt diſtreſſes, which will ſufficiently evince, that the greatneſſe of outward evill is not inconſiſtent with his love toward his chaſtened ones.</p>

Alas, not one, no not one among poore creatures: but love in chaſtening doth ſupport; Grace metes out affliction to the ſtrength of the poore ſoule, and ſupplies ſtrength to the meaſure of affliction.

                  <p n="1">1. Be not yet diſmayed, poore ſoule, there is hope concerning this thing, though but little action yet appearing; it may be the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdome would abaſe thy pride, and make thee ſee thy ſelfe how low thou art, and therefore hath ſtruck and left thee for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without ſtrength; this is his goodneſſe ſometimes,<note place="margin">Iob 2.13.</note> and his way to ſave men: thus <hi>Job</hi> ſate ſeven dayes dumb before his friends

I am ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged every day, but never the better; If the end of Gods chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be ſharing in his holineſſe, or the fruit of righteouſneſſe, I am a ſtranger unto God, and theſe; therefore may I conclude, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance hath ſeiſed on me from my Judge, not chaſtening from a father, for I am unholy, and unrighteous ſtill in the midſt of the fires, barren and vile under all the prunings of God.</p>

But is it all true, that thou haſt ſaid, and are there no iſſues of good from the Rod upon thy heart? Give me leave a little to ſearch, and try what anſwer thy ſpirit in truth can make to ſome queries. Tell mee, deare Chriſtian, after all thy ſcourgings, how are thy
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:111779:48"/>thoughts concerning God and Chriſt, and ſin and ſelfe? Truly I think my ſelf the vileſt of creatures; I have cauſe to do ſo, even as loathſome as the Devils, and ſin I judge to be worſe then death and hell it ſelfe; and God I know to be that High and holy One (O that I were like him!) and Chriſt I confeſſe the only way to God; O that I could reach him, and by him move unto the Father! Now pray tell mee, are not theſe right thoughts? Hath not the time been that thou haſt had harder thoughts of God, and better of thy ſelf? harſh of Chriſt, and pleaſant concerning ſin? Haſt not thou called ſometimes ſweet bitter, and bitter ſweet? Is not this the rectitude or righteouſneſſe of God ſtampt upon thy minde? Is not this a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſharing in his holineſſe? Tell mee then, how is thy heart, how ſtands thy affections? what doeſt thou hate, what doeſt thou love, what doeſt thou feare, and what doeſt thou deſire, where is thy delight? Speake Chriſtian; and canſt thou ſay otherwiſe than thus, ſurely I would love God, deſire after him, and delight in him; I would feare to grieve, I would hate ſin, and abhor my ſelfe for ever: And is not this rectitude in thy affections? and hath not the Rod turned thy heart more this way? Nay, once again tell me, O thou afflicted! which way is thy face? whither bendeſt thou in wayes and walkings? Is not God thy mark? yea, I would hit that, and reach him, if I could, but alas, I do not, I cannot, it's but little, it's but little that my heart or wayes are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to God-ward. Yet a little is worth as much as life: ſhall wee deny any, becauſe we have not all? Doe not ſo poore ſoule, leſt thou wrong God in denying his grace; acknowledge this and kiſſe the rod, ſo will greater grace appeare. But ſuppoſe the fruit were ſo little, as ſcarcely viſible; yet there is hope, by exerciſe, waiting and bleſſing from heaven, the dry rod may bloſſome, and bring forth abundantly: kill not thy ſelfe with faithles doubts, with thoſe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ones, that ſay there is no hope, and therefore conclude no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther labour is here uſefull, no, no, there is yet hope in the latter end, the ſplitting of an oake by ſtorme may ſpread the life of it into new ſprouts, in ſtead of killing it; beleeve, beleeve and be eſtabliſhed, abide in Chriſt cloſe, and yee ſhall bring forth much fruit to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers glory.

This is a generall repreſentation of that chaſtening care, which inforceth cheerfulneſſe on Gods afflicted, ſo that the Apoſtle injoyneth therefore or for this cauſe, lift up the hands, &amp;c.

As the ſunne gives influence to the matter it animates, and therefore it muſt live, becauſe it partakes of that quickening power: So no leſſe, nay much more this higheſt providence muſt neceſſitate the creature to expreſſe the influence of it, and give out it's effect in return of duty, unto which it doth incline. Now in this ſpeciall conſideration of providence about the Rod, both the cauſe ordering it, and effect upon the ſoule produced by chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, muſt needs incline it to receive incouragement. In the Cauſe we have the Father primarily putting out in this Rod his power and his love, the Son next to him Mediator-like, ſweetening the Rod, with all the gracio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s fruits of his merit and interceſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will ſuffer it to be laid on, or to ſmart upon the fleſh; the Spirit proceeding from both theſe, whoſe name is therfore eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Comforter, manageth the Rod, brings all the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt with it to his members, and effectually ſo applyeth the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering grace, that it muſt needs keep up the ſoule from fainting, and incline it to ſweet and heavenly refreſhing in the very fires. The promiſe the rule of this providence carryeth no leſſe the arme of God to help, and his counſels too are all inabling words in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Strengthen the weak hands, and confirme the feeble knees, ſay to them that are of a fearfull heart, Be ſtrong, Feare not.</hi>

                        </gap>4.</note> No ſooner
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:111779:53"/>ſpoken thus from God by his Spirit, but it is created, and ſo ſet in the ſtation of comfort, unto which God calleth the poore ſoule. In the Effect alſo of this providence, which is all the ſoules profit, the hearts good, and that evidently effected upon the man, eminently is this force ſeen, for good, and nothing but good, of which this is the beſt here intended, can cheer a ſoule, and that muſt, and will do it, if it be not miſtaken; Let me therefore, in ſhort, thus argue and conclude with our Apoſtle, Your eyes are opened, and light pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, therefore you muſt ſee; or your eares boared, and voyce ſent out, therefore yee muſt heare; or the the Sunne is now in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Aequinoctiall, therefore the earth muſt ſpring, all neceſſarily follow by influence imparted. So here as ſtrongly, Gods chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing providence hath ſweetly touched you, therefore lift up the hands that hang down, and feeble knees, be cheerfull and revived; yee muſt be ſo, if the ſweet vertue of that providence have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon your ſpirits.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To add to this, If ſtrength of reaſon have force upon a man to perſwade him to any thing, the ſtrongeſt reaſon is here, from ſweetneſſe of chaſtening to draw the afflicted to the duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving. Take a little draught of reaſoning, the Fathers love is in the Rod, therefore ſhould we be comforted, not dejected; The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator ſweetens it, therefore ſhould not we faint, but be refreſhed; the Spirit meaſures it, and ſanctifies it, therefore ſhould we be glad under it; the Promiſe is the rule of diſpenſation, and the effect our true and eternall good, therefore ſhould we be incouraged, and live cheerfully above the ſmart. If we be men, here is reaſon, the ſtrongeſt reaſon of God to draw us to revivings, when we begin to faint: if from ability to duty, and from free and glorious mercy to duty be a ſtrong way of reaſoning, then this muſt prevaile, God chaſtens, therefore ſhould we be cheerfull, and not let our ſpirits ſinke, when ſuch ſupport is given to hold us up.</p>
                  <p>To the third Quere then,<note place="margin">3. What is the Duty?</note> What is the afflicteds duty? it will now be needfull to returne; we ſee the providence chaſtening, the comfortable conſiderations therein preſented, and their force to revive and comfort; all the vertue and force of conſolation is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Gods ſide, but the duty in the uſe and application is upon ours; God gives the reaſon of our cheerfulneſſe in his work, and we muſt returne performance anſwerable in our duty, God gives the life, but we muſt lift up hands and knees our ſelves. But what is this lifting up preciſely? Surely it concernes us to know whoſe duty it is to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:111779:53"/>do it; It is an expreſſion fitted to the former metaphor of hanging hands, and palſie knees, however friends may be about ſupporting, chaſing, cheering theſe fallen, fainting and dying members, yet the very patient himſelfe muſt put forth the ſtrength hee hath to raiſe theſe diſeaſed parts out of this ſad and pining poſture, and ſo ſtrive to diſpoſe them that the remedies applied may bring forth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired eaſe and reviving. Reſolve the precedent dolefull Embleme properly into hearts fallen, trembling and fainting under Gods cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliſement, and this lifting up muſt note a ſutable work in the chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for removing this ſpirit-palſie, and heart-failing. The notation of the name or word it ſelf, may help in this; it is plainly in it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignificate, to erect or ſet upright in it's place, ſomething diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted, or fallen from it's proper ſtation; wee reade it uſed by Chriſt to expreſſe his cure upon the crooked woman,<note place="margin">

No leſſe here is it a Paraphraſe of comfort to the ſoule bowed downe, and heart infeebled; to lift it up, is to ſet it in it's right ſtate and poſture towards God, for receiving the comfortable influences of his chaſtening providence, which it cannot do while it hangs down, and lyeth in it's palſie fits: Now then a right po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, or erecting of the heart, that it may be capable of, and meet with the conſolations of God in his ſcourging love, is the duty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us; when the ſpirit is ſet right and even with God for his revivings, then is head and all lifted up with comfort, when it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, or hangs down another way, it ſwerves from Gods intended refreſhings. The nature, ſubject and condition of this duty would be known to guide us to it. Firſt, the nature of this duty, in ſhort, is to diſpoſe our ſelves by the help of that gracious influence given out by the ſpirit of the Rod, to receive theſe cordiall revivings which the chaſtening providence hath ordered to us: How unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy is it, that God ſhould hold out ſuch ſweet incouragements to his chaſtened children, and they, in a kinde of unbelieving diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, never regard him? So troubled are they with the ſmart, that they will not once minde the ſweet of the Rod: This is utterly a fault; therefore let us know Gods Will in this, and do it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Plainly thus, by putting out that ſpirituall ſtrength we have,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> into
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:111779:54"/>activity or motion, for ſetting the heart in the right frame to ſure with the conſolations of God; in the Prophets phraſe,<note place="margin">Iſa. 64.7.</note>

                     <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoule?</hi> &amp;c. This is our work, to call up, and ſtir up our hearts from over-powering dejection to reach to the conſolations of a chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing father held forth in the very Rod. But whereunto ſhould we call or ſtir them for attaining this? Even to theſe duties following, that ſet them in a right frame for comfort.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To believing, and by Faith, to a ſingle and attentive eyeing of all theſe comfortable conſiderations which the Fathers care diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in every Rod for the good of his chaſtened ones; So to view them, that Faith may make them evident, which were formerly obſcured, under ſmart of outward evill, and make them really ſubject, which to ſenſe ſeem not to be where they are; and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all, and make them properly our own, which is Faiths pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar; it doth but touch and take, God himſelf, and all that God hath. It was the ground of the Prophets complaint, <hi>There is none that ſtirreth up himſelfe to take hold of thee;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 64.7.</note> What was the reaſon, they ſaw Gods face hid from them in their dark and ſad condition, and themſelves conſumed by the hand or means of their own iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but they could believe no good in this ſevere hand of God toward them; therefore they lye ſtill in their ſinking, and will not ſo much as ſtir themſelves to take hold of God. This is great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the holy One. Stir up our hearts wee muſt to Faith on the comforting part of the Rod, if wee would have them right and ſet to meet with the revivings of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To hoping, and waiting for the giving out of theſe cordials from the chaſtiſing hand; Thus <hi>David</hi> calls to his ſoule in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities; <hi>Why art thou diſquieted within me, hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him,</hi>

                     <hi>who is the health of my countenance and my God.</hi> The patient ſoule ſhall never looke for help or comfort from God in vain; ſuch hope cannot make the ſoule aſhamed; O ſtirre up fainting hearts to hope we muſt; that ſweet hand that ſcourgeth, will give out gracious ſupport to that good heart that hopeth, activity is our duty in this alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To crying, and earneſt ſupplication to our chaſtening God, to ſend out ſweet out of the ſmart, and meat out of the eater, then we ſet our ſelves in a right poſture for receiving mercy, when our drooping hearts are ſtirred up to pray, and cry for thoſe gracious
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:111779:54"/>diſcoveries: It was alſo <hi>Davids</hi> activity,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.6.</note> when he wanted the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his God, he falls to crying, <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me;</hi> The heart is ſet upright, when it can pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hardeſt preſſures; and this is duty to pray and cry for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: Though we ſhould be neer the ſhadow of death, yet muſt we not let our hearts fall downe; It is a diſmall fall, to be thrown from prayer; If God hold out ſo much ſweet comfort in his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening government, and ſevereſt diſcipline, it is the leaſt wee can do to fetch it out by prayer; Lift we up then our ſoules to God, that he may lift up his favour upon us; This is the duty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſubject of this duty is the chaſtened and dejected ſoule; they, even they muſt rouſe up their drooping ſpirits, and ſtrive for comfort, God gives the grace, but they muſt look narrowly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the duty for their own reviving; It is all I ſhall note here, that to them is this ſpoken, and on them is only this duty preſſed; the afflicted muſt not be only paſſive under comfort, but active for it, lifting up themſelves, and putting forward to it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The condition of this duty I ſhall only touch in the property of the act, which muſt needs be here free and voluntary; ſo that as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coms the people of God to be willing in all duties, no leſſe doth God expect it from them in this; that as he is ready and willing to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter his reviving influence unto his chaſtened, ſo they with anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deſire, ſhould ſet themſelves to look for and receive it: much wil in this makes the duty more obediential, &amp; the effect more ſweet and comfortable to the diſtreſſed ſoul; yet from this uſually chaſtened ſouls are moſt averſe, altogether unwilling to becomforted; therefore unto this ſhal I labor to perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the inſuing applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this truth</p>

My work therfore now is to preſſe that obedience to Gods comforting will in his chaſtenings, which we acknowledge a duty to his commanding will in all other particulars. If God intend this in his Rod, not to kill, but to quicken, not to deſtroy, but ſave, not to caſt down, but to raiſe up; and therefore hath ſpirited his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:111779:55"/>Rod to incline his afflicted to lifting up, and by all the reaſon of his diſcipline ingageth them not to fainting, but to cheering hearts: Let me ſpeak to you for God, and from God in this matter, Come yee afflicted of the Lord, gird up your loynes, hearken unto me, will yee keep thoſe hearts ſad, which God will not have kept ſad? O ſin not againſt God in this, as yee would by no means ſin in other caſes; if he ſay lift up your hands, do not yee hang them downe, if he call to rectifying and ſtrengthening feeble knees, let them not fall into palſie fits; if hee cheere up your hearts under the Rod, do not yee make them faint through unbeliefe, and ſo kill your ſelves. I need not ſtate the duty againe, what God would have you do in this caſe. Reade over thoſe cordiall conſiderations in the ſcourging Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence under which yee lie; ſet before your eyes the relation, power and tenderneſſe of a chaſtening Father, ſtirre up your ſelves to hope for, and call out all the ſweetneſſe in that Fountain, both of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of your affliction; view the Mediator of the Rod, and rouſe up your hearts to take hold of him your Pattern, your guide in this uncouth way of trouble, he will bring you out: Conſider the rule of the Rod, it can do no more hurt than what the promiſe hath in it, for this orders it, and nothing but good can iſſue from the Word of promiſe: or, in a word, looke to the end of all your afflictions, it is righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt; now ſtirre up your ſelves, and feed and live upon theſe comforts, account it your work, and as naturally a duty as any, to call up your ſouls out of troubles, to lift them up in Faith, in Hope, in Prayer to meet the reviving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of God given out with the Rod unto you; let mee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come you but in this; that it is your duty to be comforted as much as to be humbled; and if reaſon or truth may prevaile, beſides the moving conſiderations in the Text, which I ſhall preſſe toward the cloſe of the work, theſe few convincing grounds I ſhall lay down in this place.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The command, counſels, and care of God, concerning this comfort to his afflicted, infallibly evinceth it a duty on their parts to attend on it, and reach forth unto it. Now, are not theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Rejoyce in the Lord alwayes,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.14. Jam 1.2. Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In all which was matter of chaſtening as well as triall, ſmart that did make ſad, as well as a cauſe that did ſupport; Counſels are frequent, let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid, lift up your heads, &amp;c. And the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:111779:55"/>exceeding great care of God to have this effected, ſtrongly proveth, it muſt not be by them neglected; two evidences of this care are in ſight: Firſt, in providing a ſpring of comfort for all caſes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe and dejection among his own children,<note place="margin">Joh. 14.16, 18.26.</note> therefore h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 40.1. Iſa. 54.11.</note> How doth he in them call upon his afflicted, <hi>O thou afflicted, and toſſed with tempeſts, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted?</hi> And doth this care of God call for no care from you, to ſee that his end be not fruſtrated, and your hearts left comfortleſſe? Reaſon muſt convince you, that yee muſt be like-minded with God, to ſuffer as hee would have you ſuffer, and be humbled as hee would have you humbled, and be comforted as he would have you comforted. Now then, if it be your duty, be as conſcionable and carefull to diſpoſe your ſelves for the comforts of God, as for any other duties to him: So yee muſt be, if yee deale truly with him, for as much as this is honour to him as much as any other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. What a reproach caſt yee upon God, to make the world judge, God cannot comfort his people? O therefore lift up the hands that hang down, and beſtirre your ſelves for comfort.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The comforts of God are not only ingagements, but inablings of poore ſoules to all other duties expected from them; ſo that ſleight theſe, yee loſe your ſtrength, and become fruitleſſe. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in the delegation of the Spirit by Chriſt to be his Churches comforter, the marke therein ſpecially intended, which is ſtill ſome main duty or other; for comfort is not given for it ſelfe, but for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends thereby attainable; therefore when Chriſt would have his diſciples know his minde, and keep in remembrance his dictates, his way is: <hi>The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 14.26.</note> 
                     <hi>hee ſhall teach you all things, and bring them to remembrance:</hi> Nothing ſo powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructs as comfort; for as much as it revives and ingageth thereby the heart firſt unto it ſelfe, and ſo brings the ſoule with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to hearken to the Word made knowne; and none can ſurpaſſe that good Diſciple, who learnes Jeſus Chriſt with delight. So
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:111779:56"/>when the Lord would have his ſervants be faithfull and bold in the teſtimony of him,<note place="margin">Joh. 15.26, 27.</note> or bearing witneſſe of his truth; this is his courſe to effect it by conſolation, <hi>I will ſend the Comforter to you from the Father, hee ſhall teſtifie of mee,</hi> and ſtrengthened by his comforts, <hi>Yee alſo ſhall beare witneſſe.</hi> Conſolations ſhall conſtrain you to do that for me, not to leave my glorious work without witneſſe to the world. Againe, If he would have people convinced of ſin in a ſaving way to melt them,<note place="margin">Joh. 16.7, 8.</note> and to drain their ſoules from filth, and draw them unto God in himſelfe, this is his way, <hi>If I depart, I will ſend the Comforter unto you,</hi> It is ſtill the Comforter that he makes uſe of (a ſweet and bleſſed notion) <hi>And when hee is come, he will convince or reprove the world of ſin;</hi> See the Comforters work, and if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and make men know their ſin, ſure it is in a comforting way, to ſeparate from it, and to leade ſoules ſafe unto Chriſt. Nothing makes ſin appeare ſo exceeding ſinfull, as comfort preſented to a wretched, rebellious, and diſobedient ſoule; the Comforter, if any, will make them aſhamed, and abhorre themſelves. It is the method of all the Apoſtles, to ingage, inable, and fortifie ſoules againſt hardeſt oppoſitions, and for greateſt duties, by the conſolations of Chriſt;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.14.</note> when they would ſet them above fiery trialls, the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The vertue or power then of this chaſtening is two-fold. 1. Phyſicall or naturall, which is the cauſe naturally producing this dutie, as the fire warmth upon that which is applied unto it; The rod makes right in beating to it; this force conſtraines by inabling. 2. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or rationall, forcing the reaſon of man to command his heart to this rectitude, and bend towards it.

Now the joynt power given out from this chaſtening Providence, to frame the ſoule to this dutie, is various.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">A teaching power.</note> Directive, which is properly a teaching power, that dictates this uprightnes of heart and walking to the chaſtened, and prompts them ſuccesfully to it; The rod hath a voice in its ſmart ſpeaking righteouſneſſe, but of it ſelfe weake, untill he that prompted it, put forth his voice in it; here the Providence chaſtiſing, or God himſelfe correcting, teacheth by it reformation or rectifying of a mans waies, and if he teach, he makes impreſſion upon the ſpirit, though creature teaching paſſe off too ſleightly. It is the note of Chriſt, in recording that promiſe,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.45.</note>

                     <hi>therefore will he teach ſinners in the way,</hi> that is, the right way; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth no leſſe immediately, The <hi>meek,</hi> or humble, or afflicted, <hi>will be guide in judgement,</hi> that is, the right path ordered by him, and <hi>the meek will be teach his way.</hi> And the happie effect of this teaching is proclaimed to the Church,<note place="margin">Pſal. 94.12.</note>

                  <p n="3">3. Active likewiſe and a power of doing or ſtirring according to the bent, or byas of the rod, doth God give out to his chaſtened ones, that they may be ſtirring and make themſelves right wayes.

                  <p>To the ſecond, the morall force of this afflicting hand upon the following duty, is the ſtrength of reaſon, which is ſo great, that it muſt needs over-power men, and make them yeeld to give out themſelves to the utmoſt for obedience, unleſſe they refuſe to be drawne with the cords of a man, and declare themſelves unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable: let theſe ſtrong reaſons be weighed for this purpoſe, iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this divine providence.</p>

Is it not the juſteſt reaſon now, that yee ſhould comply with this love of the Mediator? is it not moſt unreaſonable to reject his love without a cauſe, and by your frowardneſſe, returne hatred for his good will?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is the Spirits free motion, that as he would ſeale you for God with his owne character, ſo he would drive you to him by the Rod, and therefore ruleth in this chaſtening, to by as your hearts to the right path; is it reaſon then to deny this ſweeteſt motion, to ſadden this Spirit, to lame our ſelves more, and turn out of the good way of God? The Oxe and the Aſſe ſhew more reſpect to their guides than this. In a word, through all theſe hands the Rod is the laſt means to rectifie a ſoule, and if this do it not, it is perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to perdition; Reſerving other conſiderations in the Text for their own place: this is the ſumme of the precedent arguments.

                  <p>THe power of Providence to help us, and reaſon from the Rod to convince us of duty, have before appeared; That we are to be doing ſomething being ſummoned by the Rod, is evident, what we muſt do, is now the queſtion. <hi>Make right paths for lame feet,</hi> we muſt, this the Rod would have, that we ſet our halting feet in Gods even wayes, to make our treadings or ſteps ſutable thereunto; Now, halting here is an unperfect or uneven walking with God, when by feares or other blaſts, we are kept from the ſtrict and right tract of converſation, from which we ſhould not ſwerve; Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then, or thorow reformation, is the morall of right paths, and right feet joyned together, which is our work to look unto; to make our thoughts right concerning God, concerning ſin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning duties, and our affections right, ſuted to various objects according to the rule, and our indeavours right, ſtriving to keep cloſe to the line of Chriſt in all our converſations.</p>
                  <p>But who can make an old heart new? or a foule one cleane,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> or that which is crooked to become ſtreight?</p>
                  <p>Surely not a creature; Therefore badly was it gloſſed by him,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that this is a notable place for Free-will, and little reaſon was there for that note here, it being but a ſimple command of God here, and Gods commands do argue the creatures debts, not their abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; otherwiſe no need of the Covenant of Grace, wherein God ingageth himſelfe to his covenanted ones, for inabling them to all duty, and then requires their anſwerable reſtipulation. Our duty then anſwering to this command, as in all like caſes, conſiſts in two parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A paſſive reception of all that influence which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in his Covenant, for rectifying our hearts;<note place="margin">Agere noſtrum eſt à Deo pati.</note> and which by correction hee indeavours to bring in upon our ſoules; this upon our parts is the firſt work of Faith, which alone is the receiving Grace, by reaſon of which reception we are ſaid to do, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God properly doth alone: As by Faith wee are ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:111779:61"/>come the ſonnes of God, as if we moved our ſelves to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, when indeed Chriſt himſelfe caſts this upon us, and we only thus receive it: So are wee ſaid to be ſaved by Faith, and live by Faith, as if we were the chief movers in theſe, when indeed God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaves, and Chriſt lives in us, we are meerly in this reſpect receivers. So are we commanded to redeeme time, to caſt off our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and make us a new heart, &amp;c. when alas, wee cannot do the work of one day, only wee receive by Faith a double portion of grace from God, in circumſpect walking, in which reſpect our time is ſaid to be bought out or redeemed: Neither can we, poore crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, make an hard heart ſoft, and an old heart new, only by Faith we receive the impreſſions of him that ſaith, I will give them a new Spirit, I will take the ſtony heart out of the fleſh, and give them an heart of fleſh: So here are wee preſſed to make ſtreight paths for feet, and even feet and walkings for paths; but indeed our making is primarily receiving this impreſſion from the hand of God, whoſe Name is right, who alone can rectifie hearts and wayes; <hi>David</hi> therefore turnes his work concerning this into a prayer of Faith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Renew a right ſpirit within me;</hi> hee is on the receiving hand, if God will give it. This then is the firſt peece of duty, Faith muſt open the man within and without, to receive the impreſſion of Gods rectitude on all; In the minde muſt be received right thoughts, right underſtanding, right judgement; In the will, a right bent or yeelding to the Will of God; In the affections a right frame, feare and love, and joy, and hatred, and griefe, ſet where they ſhould be: And in the eye a right ſeeing, in the eare a right hearing; in all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers a right moving power unto God. This, this is our work to make right paths.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An active expreſſion of what is received from God; Faith works this way alſo by love to God, giving out thoſe right impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which the ſoule hath received from him: Now this active part of duty Faith performes in theſe particulars, intimated in the very terms of the Text.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By evidencing and ſetting before the ſoule the right wayes, or Lawes of God, which are called his paths, and that in the power and ſoveraignty of them; as being ſet up to command obedience and conformity from creatures to them: As the Prophet ſpeaks for God, <hi>The wayes of the Lord are right, the juſt ſhall walk in them;</hi> they are ſoveraign wayes, and muſt have walkers in them. Faith makes theſe ſupreme, or higheſt in the thoughts and eſteem of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:111779:61"/>no leſſe in their affections and indeavours. Now this is a great ſtep to rectitude of heart and walking, to acknowledge the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of the right wayes of God over our bodies and ſpirits; And indeed, Gods wayes, as they are all higher than mans, ſo are they ſoveraigne and commanding, as himſelf is, which he will not ſhall be under check. Thus Faith eſtabliſheth,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.31.</note> or ſets the Law in power over the believers heart, and ſo ſubjects it in right and due order to Gods command: Here is one act toward making of right paths for our feet, or ſteering a right courſe of life from the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rod. So hee makes right paths for his feet, who ſets them by faith to command his feet to walk in them.</p>

By ſetting our lame and halting feet in this right track drawn out for them; that is, plainly, by an exact and watchfull keeping of our hearts &amp; converſations in due order and reſpect unto thoſe right and even wayes of God; thus our making right paths, is our ſtrict attendance on them; This uſe <hi>David</hi> made of the Rod, hee kept Gods Word, and learn'd his Statures better. Now, if Faith do ſo evidence the excellency of Gods right wayes, and ſtirs up love in the ſoule vehemently to them, obedience ſutable muſt be the effect, which will be the demonſtration of that upright frame, unto which by charſtening the Lord hath drawn them. I believe, therefore have I ſpoken, ſaith the Prophet, Wee believe, therefore we ſpeak, ſay the Apoſtles; ſure it is, Faith ſtirs up all the affections of the ſoul and members of the body, love, feare, delight, eyes, eares, hands, and feet to that right worke which it holds forth; ſo he makes right paths for his feet, that by Faith makes himſelfe to walk in them.</p>

                  <p>TO the ſecond, haltters in affliction are very apt to become Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; if comfort may ſtop, and reformation prevent this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieſe, all reaſon will perſwade the lame ſoule to make earneſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe.</p>
                  <p>But why ſhould ſuch an argument as this be uſed to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, leſt that which is lame be turned out of the way,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> when it is certain they cannot fall off from God unto perdition?</p>
                  <p>It is not irrationall to uſe ſuch motives for duty to the moſt ſtable and unſhaken ſoules in the Church here Militant,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and therefore not unuſefull with the Spirit of God to preſſe them upon the beſt of men, to keep them cloſe to their obedience; Theſe conſiderations may evince the neceſſity of ſuch arguing toward theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, they are rationall creatures, grace hath not ſwallowed up reaſon, nor deſtroyed the man, though it over-power and innoble it for heaven. Now to all ſuch, all <hi>reaſon-foreing</hi> and convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are ſutable; now prevention from finall Apoſtaſie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is a forcible conſideration to every rationall creature to take heed of the halting evill that leads unto it, and make uſe of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives, comforts, counſels, for rectifying and eſtabliſhing that will certainly keep the ſoules from it; therefore meet for the beſt as well as for the worſt of men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are (even the beſt) in great part carnall, and ſold under ſin, as the Apoſtle was, and every one is, in the firſt great bill of ſale by mans tranſgreſſion, however in Chriſt redeemed, and ſet above the power of corruption; yet even in this ſtate of grace ſin is in them as thornes in their ſides, and pricks in their eyes; and therefore ſtrongly inclining them to fall from God, however they be kept by the power of God unto ſalvation. This did ſo terrifie that holy man, that he cried out, <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> Where then diſeaſes are, though not predominant, it is not unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to preſſe for care to prevent death.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, conſider the ground of their eſtabliſhment; That they cannot fall away from God, is not from any ſtrength or ability in themſelves to ſtand, nor indeed from any creature Conſideration, for mutability and change is the creatures adjunct, but it is meerly grounded upon the Covenant of God to Chriſt and to his ſeed, wherein his power, wiſdome, juſtice, truth, and immutability are
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:111779:64"/>freely ingaged to keep theſe ſoules from perdition unto eternall life. Now, that wiſdome that hath contrived the perſeverance of theſe to glory, who are ſo fraile and unſtable in themſelves, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo caſt the way whereby he will accompliſh this promiſed end, and deals with them, as well rationally as powerfully to effect this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; It pleaſeth therefore this <hi>God-wiſdome,</hi> to ſute arguments to the ſtate of his creatures, he ſeeth the remainders of pride in their fleſh, that upon conceit of priviledge, may puffe up, and make ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and thence thinks fit to preſſe ſome terrible conſiderations to ſuppreſſe ſuch ſwellings, and keep the ſoule in an humble and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving feare, whereby it is inabled to ſteer it's courſe directly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and to reach home unto him; however indeed the argument of it ſelfe cannot prevaile, but the power of God in it drawes over the heart to yeeld obedience: no unreaſonableneſſe then to preſſe the fixed ones of God with ſuch ſhaking reaſon, for this way God doth faſten them in his Kingdome. This rub removed, two things muſt be declared to open the force of this motive: firſt, that halting doth incline to Apoſtaſie: ſecondly, that there is a death-preventing vertue in the former duties, to keep from this fall. For diſcovery of the firſt, the demonſtration will be cleer in their properties of halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are inſeparable from it, however vincible by grace.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. The crookedneſſe or uneven treading of the lame walking feet muſt needs incline to greater wandrings; perverſneſſe in, tends directly to averſenes from the wayes of God.

The Lord therefore chideth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples out of their crooked and perverſe diſpoſition,<note place="margin">Matt. 17.17.</note>

It is evident in theſe now, that halting doth of it ſelf incline to pernicious Apoſtaſie, and the ſouls deſtruction. But why this a motive to comfort, and conformity or rectifying wayes to God? The reaſon of this muſt be the vertue of theſe duties for prevention of this diſmall evill: The next conſideration.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond. The power in the former duties effectuall for cure of this evill, is twofold. 1 Primitive, to turn away thoſe pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maladies that breed and bring forth this Apoſtaſie. 2 Poſitive, to keep the ſoul in a true and perfect ſtate with God: this more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is conſiderable in the ſecond motive for healing, the former is the work for preſent to ſtate that. Now theſe two duties, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and amendment, are ſweetly fitted againſt two ſorts of evils, that work this overthrow of poore ſouls; ſome are weakning evils that diſable the ſoul to ſtand againſt it, others are perverting evils, thruſting the ſoul out of Gods way into perdition: Comfort is the cure of theſe, and Reformation the bane of theſe; whereof ſomething would be diſcovered more diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The conſolations of Chriſt whereſoever they come, remove theſe weakning and diſ-inabling evils which lay the ſoul more open, naked, and obnoxious to the miſchief of all Apoſtarizing corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the ſtating of thoſe evils with the application of this remedie
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:111779:65"/>will be here convenient. 1 The fading of light for diſcoverie of God in Chriſt reconciled, makes the ſoul very weak, apt to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſide from the truth, having loſt God out of the eye; for want of light indeed many times a poore ſoul is turned into an hell of ſin and miſerie; for who can be ſolicitous to keep cloſe to God, who ſeeth him not, or at leaſt not reconciled? To this the comforts of Chriſt do give ſoveraigne help, for which cauſe it muſt be, that the Apoſtle in hsi method of bringing the Churches to the abundant knowledge of the myſterie of God in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Col. 2.2.</note> he ſtrives firſt <hi>that their hearts might be comforted:</hi> and thence would he draw them <hi>to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the full aſſurance of underſtanding to the acknowledgement of,</hi> or inſight into, the <hi>myſterie of God, of the Father, and of Chriſt.</hi> And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no ſoul can be ſo intimately acquainted with the ſecret of God in Chriſt, the great preſervative againſt Apoſtaſie, but that ſoul that taſtes of his ſweet and raviſhing conſolations, and hath his heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived by him: reach after Chriſts comforts then they muſt, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire fully to ſee him, and ſeeing to be eſtabliſhed by him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The fainting of hope, and therewith the decay of vitall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits is a very great weaking, and expoſeth of it ſelf to death, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a remedie be timely; and none better than the conſolations of God for removing of this dangerous obſtruction, and reviving the drooping ſpirit. Alas, the dying of hope leaves the ſoul as a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thing, turns it into a miſerable ſtate of confuſion and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it is even readie to curſe God ſometimes unawares and die, and lieth liable hereby to the tempters furie to be hurried into a ſoul-killing deſpair. Now to give life to this hope, the Apoſtle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores God for his poore Romanes; but under what notion? hear his words,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.5.13.</note> once the <hi>God of conſolation,</hi> or the comforting God: and again, <hi>the God of hope,</hi> even that makes to hope, <hi>fill you with all joy, and peace in beleeving, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> It is then the comforting and hope-raiſing God, that can create hope, and by hope joy, and by joy eſtabliſhment, for his poore creatures; Conſolation and the comforting power in God bears all this work. The Pſalmiſt found this vertue of divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,<note place="margin">Pſal. 94.19.</note> 
                     <hi>In the multitude of my thoughts within me</hi> (confuſion of thoughts were within him what courſe to take, whether to ſtick to God, or leave him) <hi>thy comforts delight my ſoul;</hi> Theſe revive and keep from ſinking: Who would not catch after theſe grcedily ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then die?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The failing of duties and vitall actions are a ſad preſage of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:111779:65"/>death, as well as a great weakning in preſent to the ſoul; every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or weak performance is like a gaſpe before giving up the ghoſt; Now no way to cure this but by cordials, and none like the comforts of Chriſt. When Chriſt himſelf was in the conflict, buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Satan to make him deny his Father, to let us ſee that our fleſh in him needed ſupport, Angels are ſent to miniſter to him, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the fleſh; how much more need hath our poore ſpiritleſſe fleſh of this?<note place="margin">Matth. 4.12.</note> For want of praying, and for want of walking, the ſoul may be ſubverted utterly, and for want of comfort it can do neither; nothing ſtrengthens the hands more to the work of God than the conſolation of Chriſt, and nothing keeps more from Apoſtaſie, then to walk circumſpectly in the wayes of God, and abound in his work. In ſad diſtempers <hi>Jeremiah</hi> reſolves to do no more work, not to ſpeak again in the name of the Lord, but when the fire burnt within him, and the comforting ſpirit inflamed him, he could not hold his tongue. Never did <hi>David</hi> fall fouler then when his heart flag'd, and fell off from dutie; and never was it well with him again, untill Gods comforts had raiſed him to his former communion.<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.1.&amp;c.</note> See how theſe conſolations as well as convictions miniſtred by <hi>Nathan,</hi> put him upon prayer again,<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.5.11.</note> to recover his fall; Nay frequently is he forced to beat the comforts of God upon his own heart to keep him from defection, and that by reaſon of weakneſſe was growing on him: dutie ſaves from Apoſtaſie, and comfort keeps up to duty; It is but reaſonable then, to prevent ſubverſion we labour for ſtrength of action towards God, and for ſupport in this, we ſtrive to take hold of comfort in our afflictions: The Goſpels comfort can onely cure ſuol-killing faintings; ſeek it, then ſeek it ye afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Other evils there are not onely perverting, but indeed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the ſoul, and ſeparating from God, unto which the ſecond dutie carrieth a vertue contrary and ſoveraigne to deſtroy them. The evils ſo incident to halting, and ſo efficient to Apoſtaſie are ſuch as theſe: unbeleef, inordinate affection, and uneven walking, whereof we may note the malignitie in themſelves, and the remedie in the duty. 1. Vnbeleefe is the ſtrong inducement of a perpetuall backſliding from God; It was therfore but a reaſonable Item of the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Hebr. 3.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Take heed, brethren, leſt there be in any of you and evill heart of unbeleef in departing from the living God:</hi> Vnbeleef will make Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates if it prevail; but now conſcience in making right paths for our feet, muſt needs drive us from haltings in faith, and if we ſecure
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:111779:66"/>our ſouls from them we are ſafe from falling. This is evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for in the dutie preſſed, for if care be to make all tracks to Heaven right, then that of faith (without which there is no having God or life) muſt needs be rectified; ſet right upon its object God in Chriſt, and right upon its work to make evident the unſeen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of Heaven, and to give ſubſiſtence to, and preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from our hoped glorie: Where this care is exerciſed, lameneſſe of faith will be relieved, and an utter Apoſtaſie ſweetly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Inordinate affection is as dangerous a furtherance to finall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from God; when affections break their bounds, tranſgreſſe their rule, and grow turbulent in the ſoul, preſſing their own way, they expoſe the ſoul to all dangerous conſequences; As when fear is more of man then of God, and love more of the creature, then of the Creator, and joy more in vanity then in reall good, that ſoul muſt be hurried to forſake God, as it fared with <hi>Demas,</hi> and other falſe named Chriſtians, in whom affections were inordinate, and out of place; But now by this rectifying work, affections are ſet in their right places, and to their right imployment, to honour God onely; ſo fear brings home to God, and love cloſeth with him, and joy is perfectly upon him; where theſe ſo work, great ſecuritie is given againſt Apoſtaſie. The Lord Chriſt therefore gives charge for right ordering affections,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.28. 1 Ioh. 2.18.</note> 
                     <hi>Fear not them that can kill the body, &amp;c.</hi> And his beloved diſciple followeth his ſteps, <hi>Love not the world, &amp;c.</hi> the Fathers love is not conſiſtent with it, this is reaſon ſtrong enough. The right ſtate of theſe keep us right with God for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Vneven walking with God, is the uſuall means of bringing him in contempt with creatures, and then of turning the heart farre from him: one crooked ſtep allowed, ſtirs up the heart to quarrell with the upirght God, becauſe his way is too ſtreight for us, and we willing to approve our own wayes rather then his, and if ſin be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to proceed, it will ſhake off from God for ever. One ſtragling ſtep put <hi>Peter</hi> at a great diſtance from Chriſt, and had he not been recalled, how pernitious might his ſlip have been? Right paths, and right diſpoſition of feet in them is the onely way to cure this evill, and to keep from utter backſliding. It is a ſweet expreſſion of <hi>Davids, I will walk in mine integritie,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 26.11.12.</note> but what courſe takes he for that? <hi>My foot</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſtandeth in an even place,</hi> right and ſtreight with God, to that poſture he holds it, and what the iſſue? <hi>In the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, I will bleſſe the Lord,</hi> and he that bleſſeth ſhall never leave
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:111779:66"/>him. <hi>Ezekiels</hi> cunſell ſhall cloſe up this,<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.30.</note> 
                     <hi>Repent, and turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions:</hi> ſet right, and keep right hearts and wayes to God; ſo, <hi>ſhall not iniquitie be your ruine:</hi> but crooked wayes lead ſurely to perdition.</p>

                     <hi>But let it rather be healed.</hi> It this the word of Gods own Spirit? Surely then God had rather that poore ſouls, lame and halting, under affliction ſhould be healed, than be hurt more, maimed, and utterly turn'd off as unuſefull for him: And as his mind is, ſo is the means he uſeth, inclined to work the health, and not the death of his chaſtened ones.

If health then, yea ſaving health be in it ſelf deſirable, reviving and reforming under the rods diſpenſation muſt be the mark to which the ſoul muſt reach; no health to be hoped for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
                  <p>The moving Conſideration then to Conſcience in former duties from the preſent word may be thus propoſed.<note place="margin">Note.</note> Gods choice is to have his rod prove rather healthfull then hurtfull to his chaſtened children; healing not killing is the prime intention of the rod, which muſt preſſe them to uſe the rod for incouragement, and amendment, who ever deſire life, and not death.

                  <p>To the firſ, I ſhall ſhortly reply; healing here is a borrowed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion fitted to that lameneſſe or halting mentioned before; both termes fetting out the evill and good eſtate of the body, but here appiled to a ſpirituall uſe; that nothing the bad, this the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the ſoul: Health is the effect of healing, and in the naturall acception thus conceived. It is the good or proſperous ſtate of life conſiſting in a due proportioned temper within, as in the right diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of parts without, and in a free communion of blood and ſpirits through the whole ſubject; whereby a man is ſaid to live well, or be well; life above diſturbance, or life in peace is truly health.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:111779:67"/>Let this be ſpiritualized, and it may fit here; ſpirituall life (of which here) is the reſult of the union of the ſoul with Chriſt; the health intended is the good and proſperous ſtate of this life, which inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſts in its duely proportioned union with Chriſt, and free communion of ſpirit from him, without fatall obſtructions of ſin, and outwardly in the light of Gods countenance, and favour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in externall bleſſings, which make this life, ſweetly comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Vpon interruption of either, this life is weakned by inward obſtructions,<note place="margin">Cant. 5.8.</note> as it was with her that cried, <hi>I am ſick of Love:</hi> and by outward obſtructions alſo is it ſomething impaired, whereupon in caſe of any outward affliction on the Church, a ſeeming eclipſe of Gods countenance,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 5 13. Jer. 8.22.</note> It is ſaid to be ſick, and the health of it out gone up nor recovered. This ſtate of health then muſt needs be very ſweet, therefore evey deſirable; unto which the rod by its comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reforming influence being duely received, doth very much advantage. The view of the ſeverall healing vertues in the duties urged, will clear this, and more forcibly preſſe to a due, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable obſervance of them, which ſhall now be laboured.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The healing vertue of true comfort ſoveraigne over all ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, lameneſſe, or halting of ſpirit to God-ward, cauſed either by ſinfull obſtructions, or dangerous ſtumblings, will be evident in theſe ſpeciall ſaving properties of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The cloſing or uniting vertue of it in caſe of any breach, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, made by obſtructive ſin between the ſoul, and Chriſt its life; oyl, and balme are therefore ſweet expreſſions of comfort, they cloſe the breaches of the fleſh, and ſo heal; no leſſe the conſolations of God: Theſe reviving influences ariſing from God, do both give forth God unto the ſoul, and draw the ſpirit back again to God. <hi>Chriſts name,</hi> that is, his ſweetneſſe are comforts manifeſted, <hi>is as oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment powred forth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. 1.8.</note> (which is attractive upon the ſenſe of ſtanders by) <hi>therefore the virgins love him,</hi> pure ſouls ſeparate from unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by love cleave to him, and are cloſed with him. O that broken and afflicted hearts, who refuſe comfort would but conſider, every touch of comfort is a cloſe of the ſoul with Chriſt, they would catch for this, that they might cloſe with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a gladding influence from this comfort, it chears the ſpirit, and makes life lightſome and pleaſant, this is health; grief makes the heart ſick, but joy reſtores it: The healing medicine of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:111779:67"/>Chriſt, his comfort is therefore ſtiled, the oyl of gladneſſe; it makes glad the heavie ſpirit,<note place="margin">Pſal. 35.7.</note> and by chearing heals the ſad diſtempers of it; no cure to be hoped for him, whoſe ſpirit is overwhelmed, and will take no gladding cordiall. Conſider thou ſad heart, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, joy revives, and grief muſt kill; take heed of ſelf-deſtroying, by rejecting gladneſſe, that will heal.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is an heart inlarging vertue in this comfort of Chriſt, and the more open the heart is to God, the more ſaving health there; Obleſſed healthy ſoul, where all influences of Chriſts Spirit have roome and paſſage to diffuſe themſelves through the man, he muſt needs be well. Grief draws up the heart like a purſe, and ſhortens the ſpirit, therefore it muſt make ſick; but Comfort opens it wide, and gives God full ſcope. Life may expatiate here, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light it ſelf, this is health indeed. O that the contracted heart, that cries out of its ſtraitneſſe unto God, would think, to be comforted is to be inlarged; every drop of this oyl opens the heart, and gives way to the Spirit of Chriſt to run to and fro freely; this is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly healthfull man.<note place="margin">Pſal. 27.4.5. Pſal. 119.32.</note> No man more hunting after comfort then <hi>David,</hi> and none more inlarged to God then he, he cals for this, and for that alſo. De we the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is a ſoul-quickning power in theſe conſolations, joy inlivens, and makes man active; not onely to live, but to be lively, this is health. This very ſight of comfort, made the Spouſe run to her beloved, and haſten him with her cries unto her,<note place="margin">Cant. 1.4. and 8.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Draw, and we will run,</hi> is her expreſſion, and <hi>Haſte my beloved</hi> is her call: The active ſoul for God muſt needs be healthfull: ſad heart, lie not ſtill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, thou art dead and dull, it is thy ſickneſſe, drink in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of Chriſt, theſe will reſtore and quicken; why refuſeſt thou to be comforted? The God of comfort, by the Son of comfort,<note place="margin">Iſa. 57.18.</note> through the Spirit of comfort, out of the promiſe of comfort, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies all this to his lame, and halt, becauſe he will have their heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not their periſhing, and perpetuates them hereby in a good ſtate of health, that it may abide with them for ever.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:111779:69"/>by Chriſtian ſoules: Heaving therefore thus touched the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theſe motives, which is their drawing force, for a cloſe of all, as God directs, I ſhall only labour to move by them to the practice of thoſe duties which concernes the chaſtened in the right uſe of their afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Heare now, yee afflicted of the Lord, Doth God ſo pity the halt and the lame, that are any way maimed by the Rod, that he chooſeth healing for them, not greater ruptures or ſubverſions? Be then of Gods minde, and clooſe your own life, not your death; for this purpoſe reaſon will guide you to take hold on comfort, and perfect reformation; Theſe are the binding, hearling wayes for the ſicke and broken; if health, yea, ſaving health, in God be ſo good, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, catch at comfort in Chriſt, cheere up, lift up hanging hands and palſie knees, purſue a through righting of the ſoule, a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, theſe will be health to the navell, and marrow to the bones. The duties have been ſtated already, looke there what is to be done; The rules of right proſecution I ſhall only adde here, that wee may walk by line, and not ſwerve, they are ſuch as theſe:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Proſecute theſe really; true comfort, and true reformation muſt be truly purſued, with reall care, purpoſe of heart, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſoule, to proſper.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Purſue them equally; as much ſtrenght and vertue are in one as other; ſeek after reviving or conſolation of Chriſt, as much as after rectifying or amendment, ſweetneſſe of life, health and ſtrength are equally promoted by both.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Follow them orderly, it may be needfull ſometimes, firſt to comfort and ſtrengthen hands and feet, before we exerciſe them to works or wayes, but then the inſeparable iſſue of comfort muſt be amendment, and right walking; be not ſhie of the conſolations of God upon pretence of unworthineſſe, theſe muſt make us worthy, at leaſt, as they are unſeparably united, let them be joyned in the proſecution; take one to diſpoſe more ſweetly to the other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Purſue them earneſtly, as a man would ſtrive for life and health, yea, and with that conſtancy, as is ſutable to that deſire of living ever; ſuch preſervatives of health make a bleſſed life, while they are in uſe, health is maintain'd, and life perfected; as yee deſire to live, then labour to be comforted, and rectiſied in Chriſt; Cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe and rectitude will eſtabliſh you for ever; Be eager, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in their purſuite; conſcience in duty will ſigne you the true
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:111779:69"/>members of Chriſt, and ſervants of the great God. Neither will your Lord forget his promiſes or covenant of his truth; In your duties he will meet you,<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.4. Zeph. 3.19.</note> 
                     <hi>He will heale your back-ſlidings, and love you free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> hee will <hi>ſave the ſoule that halteth:</hi> though the Rod ſmart a while, your pain ſhall be your gain; it is your Father that chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, he ſeekes not your fainting, but reviving, not your evill in hardening, but your good in reforming, not your ſubverſion, but converſion to him, not your ſickneſſe, nor your death, but your life, and everlaſting health: ſeek yee alſo and yee ſhall finde. The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening Father, the mediating Sonne, the comforting and quickening Spirit, are all ingaged to give in the ſweet and full fruit of chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing providence to your ſoules; ſtrainten not your own bowels, but open to them, and labour with them. By that Spirit of joy and love, through the Prince of peace, and Son of love, give glory to that tender Father, who is God-Love, bleſſed for ever: from him this one God in three are all things, to him be glory in the Churches for ever and for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
